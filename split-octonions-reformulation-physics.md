# Split octonions and the reformulation of fundamental physics

Split octonions represent a fascinating mathematical framework at the intersection of abstract algebra and theoretical physics, offering potential pathways to reformulate both general relativity and the standard model of particle physics. This non-associative 8-dimensional algebra with signature (4,4) differs fundamentally from standard octonions through its pseudo-Euclidean structure, creating unique properties that may encode deep physical principles.

## The mathematical architecture of split octonions

Split octonions emerge from the Cayley-Dickson construction as the fourth and final normed division algebra, following real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions. Unlike their standard counterparts with positive-definite signature (8,0), split octonions possess a **split signature (4,4)** that naturally accommodates the distinction between space and time dimensions. An element can be written as x = x₀ + x₁i + x₂j + x₃k + x₄ℓ + x₅ℓi + x₆ℓj + x₇ℓk, where the quadratic form N(x) = x₀² + x₁² + x₂² + x₃² - x₄² - x₅² - x₆² - x₇² creates a pseudo-Euclidean space R⁴'⁴.

The most striking property is their **non-associativity**: (xy)z ≠ x(yz) in general, though they satisfy the weaker alternative law where any subalgebra generated by two elements remains associative (Artin's theorem). This non-associative structure is preserved by the automorphism group G₂⁽²⁾, the split real form of the exceptional Lie group G₂, a 14-dimensional group that generates specific rotations in the (3+4)-vector parts of split octonions.

## Spacetime geometry and gravitational physics

The connection between split octonions and general relativity emerges through several remarkable correspondences. The split signature naturally embeds Minkowski spacetime structure, with physical signals represented as 8-dimensional split octonionic numbers containing one scalar (time), three vector-like spatial coordinates, three pseudovector-like elements providing additional time-like coordinates, and one pseudoscalar unit. This representation suggests **spacetime itself may be fundamentally octonionic** rather than merely 4-dimensional.

Researchers like **John Fredsted** have developed octonionic generalizations of general relativity starting from the vierbein formulation and extending to an "achtbein-based" action using octonionic structure constants. **V. Dorofeev** has proposed treating gravitational interactions as the non-associative part of an octonionic field Lagrangian, where the Lagrangian is defined as squared curvature with respect to octonion fields in "charge space."

Perhaps most intriguingly, the **non-associativity of split octonions may naturally encode spacetime curvature**. While traditional associative algebras require flat spacetime, the failure of associativity (ab)c ≠ a(bc) could correspond to the path-dependence of parallel transport in curved spacetime. This provides a possible algebraic origin for gravitational effects rather than treating curvature as a purely geometric phenomenon.

The automorphism group G₂⁽²⁾ generates transformations that reduce to the standard 6-parameter Lorentz group in the classical limit, but with crucial differences: active and passive transformations in split octonionic space are not equivalent, unlike in standard spacetime. This non-equivalence may reflect deep physical principles about the nature of spacetime transformations.

## Particle physics and the standard model

The application of split octonions to particle physics has yielded surprisingly concrete results. **Cohl Furey's** pioneering work demonstrates that one generation of Standard Model fermions maps naturally onto the 8-dimensional octonionic structure, with the algebra R⊗C⊗H⊗O acting on itself describing all particle representations. The Standard Model gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) emerges directly from octonionic automorphisms and ladder operators.

**Merab Gogberashvili** has shown that elementary particles can be modeled as zero divisors of split octonion algebra, with the Standard Model particle spectrum emerging from the classification of primitive zero divisors. The automorphism group G₂ contains SU(3) as a subgroup, naturally explaining the origin of color symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.

Split octonions incorporate **chirality through their geometric structure**, with the two possible orientations of the split octonionic Fano plane corresponding to different chiralities. This provides a natural mechanism for parity violation in weak interactions. Electric charge quantization emerges because charges correspond to integer eigenvalues of number operators in the octonionic framework.

The three-generation puzzle of particle physics may find resolution through split octonionic structures. Each of the 480 possible octonion multiplication tables corresponds to 7 split octonion variants, potentially relating to the generation structure. Complex octonion approaches using C⊗O can build SU(3)ᶜ representations for all three generations.

## Unified field theory approaches

Split octonions offer tantalizing possibilities for unified field theories. The exceptional Jordan algebra of 3×3 self-adjoint octonionic matrices provides a natural home for Standard Model symmetries, with the symmetries preserving specific splits yielding exactly the gauge group structure. **Ivan Todorov's** work demonstrates how this approach naturally incorporates the Standard Model's internal space algebra within Cl₁₀.

Connections to exceptional Lie groups provide pathways to grand unification. The exceptional Jordan algebra naturally embeds in E₆, while octonionic constructions accommodate Spin(10) GUT models. Multiple researchers have explored how split octonionic frameworks might unify gravity with other forces through geometric principles, with 10-dimensional spacetime emerging naturally from several approaches.

**Geoffrey Dixon's** division algebra framework R⊗C⊗H⊗O, pioneered in the 1970s-80s, naturally leads to 10-dimensional spacetime, connecting to string theory. His comprehensive mathematical treatment laid foundations that researchers continue to build upon today.

## The work of key researchers

The field has been shaped by several key figures whose contributions span decades. **Cohl Furey** at Cambridge has systematically developed the connection between division algebras and particle physics, successfully constructing the full Standard Model symmetry group for one generation and recently extending to three generations using complex octonions. Her work on charge quantization shows how fundamental physical properties emerge from mathematical structure.

**Tevian Dray and Corinne Manogue** at Oregon State have provided extensive geometric insights through their textbook "The Geometry of the Octonions" and research connecting octonions to exceptional groups E₆, E₇, and E₈. Their recent work on "Octions: An E8 description of the Standard Model" continues to push boundaries.

**Carlos Castro Perelman** has developed octonionic gravity theories and explored extended relativity in Clifford spaces, working on grand unification programs that incorporate gravity with Standard Model forces through C⊗H⊗O-valued theories.

## Mathematical power and fundamental challenges

The mathematical advantages of split octonions are compelling. They naturally explain why physical space has three dimensions through their exactly three space-like parameters. The (4,4) signature accommodates spacetime plus internal dimensions. Physical signals modeled on split-octonion geometry exhibit conventional (3+1)-theory properties including maximal velocities and Heisenberg uncertainty.

However, **non-associativity creates severe challenges**. The fundamental incompatibility with standard quantum mechanics arises because non-associative algebras cannot be represented as linear operators on Hilbert spaces. This makes standard quantization procedures impossible, requiring alternative approaches that remain underdeveloped. Computational complexity is enormous - direct multiplication requires 64 real multiplications and 56 additions, with more efficient algorithms still computationally intensive.

Split octonions contain non-zero non-invertible elements (zero divisors), unlike standard octonions. The 480 different possible multiplication tables create ambiguity in physical applications. Perhaps most critically, no clear experimental predictions have emerged from octonionic physics, leaving the field largely phenomenological rather than predictive.

## Current research frontiers and future directions

Recent conferences like the 2021 Perimeter Institute workshop "Octonions and the Standard Model" and the 2023 "OSMU23 Octonions, Standard Model, and Unification" series indicate growing interest. Active research groups at Cambridge (Furey), Oregon State (Dray/Manogue), and collaborations in Europe continue pushing boundaries.

Promising research avenues include developing consistent gravitational theories using split octonions, computational models exploring octonionic multiplication tables, extensions to higher Cayley-Dickson algebras like sedenions, and connections to quantum information theory. Some models predict **sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates**, while others suggest new insights into CP violation and matter-antimatter asymmetry.

## A balanced assessment

Split octonions represent a mathematically elegant framework that reveals surprising connections between abstract algebra and fundamental physics. The natural emergence of gauge groups, spacetime structure, and particle properties from octonionic mathematics is compelling. The connection to exceptional Lie groups and the completion of the normed division algebra hierarchy suggests deep mathematical significance.

Yet substantial obstacles remain. The non-associative nature creates fundamental incompatibilities with quantum mechanics that may prove insurmountable. Computational difficulties limit practical applications. Most critically, the lack of concrete experimental predictions prevents octonionic physics from moving beyond mathematical speculation to testable science.

The field stands at a crossroads. While researchers like Furey have made genuine progress connecting octonions to known physics, whether split octonions represent a fundamental reformulation of physics or merely a beautiful mathematical curiosity remains an open question. The next decade may reveal whether these exotic algebraic structures hold keys to understanding nature's deepest mysteries or remain, as Pierre Ramond warned, like "Sirens to Ulysses" - seductive but ultimately leading nowhere.

The mathematical beauty and unexpected physical connections ensure split octonions will continue attracting theoretical physicists seeking new perspectives on old problems. Whether they ultimately provide the breakthrough needed to move beyond current theories or remain an elegant mathematical footnote in physics history, their study has already enriched our understanding of the deep connections between mathematics and physical reality.
