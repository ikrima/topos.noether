# An Experimental Roadmap for Testing Meta-Mathematical Unification

**Authors**: [Written for experimental physicists and funding agencies]

## Executive Summary

The meta-mathematical framework makes specific predictions testable with current or near-future technology. We identify five experiments ranked by feasibility, cost, and potential impact. The framework can be definitively validated or falsified within 10 years using existing facilities plus targeted upgrades. Total cost estimate: $500M over 10 years, comparable to a single large particle physics experiment but with broader impact across quantum technology, gravitational astronomy, and fundamental physics.

5. Look for discontinuities at m = m_P/n

**Prediction**: 
```
τ_coherence ∝ {
    (m_P/m)^2        for m ≠ m_P/n
    (m_P/m)^{3/2}    for m = m_P/n

    level = tower.level_from_mass(source_masses)
    
    # Compute spectrum
    f_gr = uf.gr_frequencies(source_masses, distance)
    f_corrections = uf.inter_theoretic_modes(level)
    
    return f_gr + f_corrections

# Run prediction

Either outcome justifies the investment.

## Call to Action

We call on the physics community to:
1. Critically examine these predictions
2. Propose additional tests
3. Form collaborations
4. Seek funding for Tier 1 experiments immediately
5. Plan for Tier 2/3 experiments

The framework makes definite predictions. Let us test them.
