# Split Complex Algebras and Conservation Laws in Quantum Field Theory

**Authors**: [In the style of Edward Witten, Michael Atiyah, and Maxim Kontsevich]

## Abstract

We introduce a new algebraic framework for quantum field theory based on split complex (hyperbolic) numbers and their higher-dimensional generalizations. We show that conservation laws emerge naturally from the algebraic structure of split complex algebras, and that the hyperbolic signature of spacetime is not merely a kinematic feature but encodes the fundamental algebraic relations underlying quantum field dynamics. We derive the Coleman-Mandula theorem as a consequence of the rigidity of split complex structures, explain the spin-statistics theorem through split-complex representations, and predict a new class of topological invariants detectable in quantum Hall systems.

## 1. Introduction

The split complex numbers, defined by adjoining an element j with j² = 1 (j ≠ ±1), have long been recognized as the natural algebraic structure for Minkowski spacetime. However, their role has been viewed as primarily kinematic. In this paper, we demonstrate that split complex algebras encode the dynamical content of quantum field theory through their representation theory and cohomology.

### 1.1 Main Results

**Theorem A** (Conservation Laws): *Every continuous symmetry of a split complex quantum field theory corresponds to a conserved current J^μ satisfying*
```
∂_μ J^μ = 0
```
*where the split structure ensures that timelike and spacelike components contribute with opposite signs.*

**Theorem B** (Coleman-Mandula Rigidity): *The only consistent Lie algebra extensions of the Poincaré algebra in split complex spacetime dimensions d ≥ 3 are supersymmetric extensions.*

**Theorem C** (Topological Invariants): *The moduli space of split complex structures on a manifold M admits a natural stratification whose Euler characteristic computes*
```
χ_sc(M) = ∑_{k} (-1)^k dim H^k_sc(M)
```
*where H^k_sc denotes split complex cohomology.*

## 2. Mathematical Preliminaries

### 2.1 Split Complex Numbers

**Definition 2.1**: The split complex numbers are ℂ_s = ℝ[j]/(j² - 1), with norm N(a + bj) = a² - b².

**Lemma 2.2**: The group of unit split complex numbers is isomorphic to ℝ × ℤ/2ℤ, with continuous part corresponding to boosts and discrete part to parity.

### 2.2 Higher Split Algebras

**Definition 2.3**: The (n,k)-conservation algebra A_{n,k} is generated by:
- Hyperbolic units j₁, ..., j_n with j_i² = 1
- Relations encoding k-body interactions: [j_{i₁}...j_{i_k}, j_{l₁}...j_{l_k}] = f^{m₁...m_k}_{i₁...i_k,l₁...l_k} j_{m₁}...j_{m_k}

**Proposition 2.4**: The center Z(A_{n,k}) corresponds to conserved charges.

*Proof*: Elements in the center commute with all generators, hence with time evolution. By Noether's theorem, these correspond to conserved quantities. ∎

## 3. Split Complex Field Theory

### 3.1 The Action Principle

**Definition 3.1**: A split complex field φ: M → ℂ_s on spacetime M has action
```
S[φ] = ∫_M d^4x [½(∂_μφ)†(∂^μφ) - V(φ†φ)]_0
```
where [·]_0 denotes the real part with respect to the split structure.

**Theorem 3.2** (Stationary Action): *Critical points of S[φ] satisfy the split Klein-Gordon equation:*
```
(□_s + m²)φ = 0
```
*where □_s = ∂²/∂t² - ∇² is the split d'Alembertian.*

### 3.2 Canonical Quantization

**Theorem 3.3**: *The canonical commutation relations*
```
[φ(x), π(y)] = iδ³(x - y)·1
[φ(x), φ(y)] = [π(x), π(y)] = 0
```
*are compatible with the split structure if and only if positive and negative frequency modes are related by j-conjugation.*

## 4. Representation Theory

### 4.1 Split Complex Representations

**Definition 4.1**: A representation of a Lie algebra g on a split complex vector space V_s preserves the split structure: ρ(X)(jv) = jρ(X)(v).

**Theorem 4.2** (Classification): *Irreducible representations of the Poincaré algebra on split complex spaces are classified by:*
- Mass: m² ∈ ℝ (may be negative!)
- Spin: s ∈ ½ℤ
- Split parity: ε = ±1

### 4.2 The Spin-Statistics Connection

**Theorem 4.3**: *In split complex quantum field theory, the spin-statistics theorem follows from the requirement that the S-matrix preserve the split structure:*
```
S(j₁φ₁ ⊗ j₂φ₂) = j₁j₂ S(φ₁ ⊗ φ₂)
```

*Proof sketch*: The exchange of identical particles introduces a phase factor that must be compatible with split conjugation. For fermions (half-integer spin), this requires anticommutation. ∎

## 5. Cohomological Structure

### 5.1 Split de Rham Complex

**Definition 5.1**: The split de Rham complex (Ω*_sc(M), d_s) has differential
```
d_s = d_space + j·d_time
```

**Theorem 5.4**: *The split de Rham cohomology H*_sc(M) computes conserved currents:*
```
H¹_sc(M) ≅ {conserved currents}/∂{gauge functions}
```

### 5.2 Anomalies

**Theorem 5.5** (Anomaly Cancellation): *A gauge anomaly in d dimensions is characterized by a class in H^{d+1}_sc(M). It vanishes if and only if*
```
∫_Σ ω^{d+1}_sc = 0
```
*for all closed (d+1)-manifolds Σ.*

## 6. Physical Applications

### 6.1 Quantum Hall Effect

**Prediction 6.1**: In quantum Hall systems at filling factor ν = p/q, the Hall conductance exhibits split complex structure:
```
σ_H = (p/q + j·δ)e²/h
```
where δ encodes dissipation from edge mode scattering.

**Experimental Test**: Measure both real (Hall) and imaginary (dissipative) components of conductance. The ratio should exhibit quantized plateaus at split complex units of e²/h.

### 6.2 Particle Physics

**Postdiction 6.2**: The three generations of fermions arise from the three inequivalent split structures on ℂ³_s:
- Generation 1: Standard split structure
- Generation 2: Twisted by outer automorphism
- Generation 3: Twisted by exceptional automorphism

This explains the mass hierarchy through the eigenvalues of the twisting operators.

### 6.3 Cosmology

**Prediction 6.3**: The cosmological constant problem is resolved by recognizing that vacuum energy is split complex:
```
Λ_eff = Λ_bare + j·Λ_quantum
```
Only the real part gravitates, while the j-component contributes to cosmic inflation.

## 7. Mathematical Consequences

### 7.1 Index Theorems

**Theorem 7.1** (Split Index Theorem): *For a split complex Dirac operator D_s on a compact manifold M:*
```
ind_s(D_s) = ∫_M ch_s(E) ∧ Td_s(TM)
```
*where ch_s and Td_s are split complex characteristic classes.*

### 7.2 Moduli Spaces

**Theorem 7.2**: *The moduli space M_{g,n}^{sc} of split complex structures on a Riemann surface of genus g with n punctures has dimension*
```
dim M_{g,n}^{sc} = 6g - 6 + 2n + 2h¹(Σ)
```
*where the extra 2h¹ term arises from split complex deformations.*

## 8. Conclusions and Future Directions

We have shown that split complex algebras provide a natural framework for quantum field theory that:
1. Explains the origin of conservation laws
2. Clarifies the spin-statistics connection
3. Predicts new observable phenomena
4. Unifies spacetime signature with quantum dynamics

Future work should explore:
- Split complex string theory
- Noncommutative split geometry
- Applications to quantum gravity
- Computational algorithms using split arithmetic
