# The Symposium on the School of Argumentation
## *Three Days at the Crossroads*

### THE FACTIONS

**The Way of Stillness** — *Laozi & Shunryu Suzuki*
The contemplatives. One speaks in paradox, the other in the deceptive simplicity of beginner's mind. They share the conviction that the deepest teaching is indirect, that mastery looks like not-trying, and that most of what passes for education is obstruction dressed as help.

**The Academy** — *Aristotle, Plato, & Marcus Aurelius*
The Western classical tradition in its full internal tension. Plato the idealist who distrusts rhetoric, Aristotle the systematizer who dignifies it, Marcus the practitioner who asks what any of it does to your *soul*. They agree on the supremacy of reason. They disagree about almost everything else.

**The Way of the Warrior** — *Miyamoto Musashi, Sun Tzu, & Yamamoto Tsunetomo*
Three strategists who share almost nothing except seriousness. Musashi the duelist who trusts only direct experience. Sun Tzu the general who trusts only preparation. And Tsunetomo — the most radical voice in the room — who wrote in the *Hagakure* that the Way of the warrior is *death*, meaning total commitment beyond calculation, beyond outcome, beyond self-preservation. He will challenge everyone, including his own faction.

**The Guest Orators** — *Cicero & Demosthenes*
Not philosophers but *practitioners*. Cicero, whose speech made Rome say "how well he spoke." Demosthenes, whose speech made Athens say "let us march." They arrive on Day Two to remind every theorist in the room what rhetoric actually *does* in the world.

# DAY ONE: *Within the Schools*
### Internal Dialogues — Each Faction Clarifies Its Position

---

## Morning: The Way of Stillness

*A garden. Tea is being prepared. Nothing is hurried.*

**SHUNRYU SUZUKI:** When I opened the San Francisco Zen Center, I did not have a plan for a Zen center. I sat zazen. Others came and sat. That was the center.

**LAOZI:** Yes. The room was already full before you arranged the cushions.

**SUZUKI:** People always ask me, "What is the right way to practice?" and I tell them: the way you are doing it right now is the right way. But they don't believe me. They think there must be some secret technique I am withholding.

**LAOZI:** The Tao that can be taught is not the eternal Tao.

**SUZUKI:** *(smiling)* And yet we teach. This is the paradox we must sit with. The question before us is: how would you build a school of argumentation? And I think our answer will be very frustrating to the others.

**LAOZI:** Good.

**SUZUKI:** In Zen, we have *shikantaza* — just sitting. No technique, no goal, no attainment. But it is not passive. It is the most active thing a human being can do, because you are being completely present without trying to get anywhere. What if a school of argumentation began the same way? Not with lessons in logic. Not with drills. With *listening*. Just listening. Listening to what the other person is actually saying, not to what you plan to say next.

**LAOZI:** The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. I have watched the other factions prepare their curricula in their minds and I see them piling up — techniques, structures, strategies, drills. Each technique becomes a thing the student grasps, and each thing grasped becomes an obstacle to seeing clearly.

**SUZUKI:** This is beginner's mind — *shoshin*. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind there are few. The best debater would be the one who enters every round with beginner's mind — not empty of knowledge, but empty of *fixed positions*. The moment you decide you know what your opponent will say, you have already lost.

**LAOZI:** So our program —

**SUZUKI:** — does not look like a program.

**LAOZI:** We teach by asking. We structure by leaving space. We prepare for competition by practicing *not-knowing*.

**SUZUKI:** The others will say this is impractical.

**LAOZI:** Water is impractical. It cannot hold a shape. And yet it carved the Grand Canyon.

**SUZUKI:** I would add one thing, though, where perhaps I differ from you slightly. I believe in *form*. In Zen we have very precise forms — how you enter the zendo, how you hold your hands, how you bow. The form is not the practice, but without the form, the practice has nowhere to live. A debate program needs *some* form. A regular meeting time. A way of beginning and ending. A ritual of respect between opponents. Not because the form is the point, but because the form creates the container for something formless to emerge.

**LAOZI:** *(long pause)* Yes. The wheel is useful because of the empty space at the hub. But there must be a wheel.

---

## Midday: The Academy

*A courtyard with columns. Plato paces. Aristotle has notes. Marcus sits with quiet attention.*

**ARISTOTLE:** Let us be systematic. We are asked to build a school of argumentation over twelve months with no resources. This is fundamentally a question of *curriculum design*, and I have some experience with this, having established a school that educated the man who conquered the known world.

**PLATO:** You're never going to stop mentioning Alexander, are you.

**ARISTOTLE:** The point is that education works. Structured, intentional education produces results. Now. The art of rhetoric has three modes of persuasion — ethos, pathos, logos. The art of dialectic has its own structure — the *Topics*, the categories, the syllogistic forms. A twelve-month curriculum should move through these systematically. Months one through three: logic and the structure of argument. Months four through six: the *topoi* — commonplaces of argument, how to find the available means of persuasion in any situation. Months seven through nine: rhetoric proper — delivery, arrangement, style, the adaptation of argument to audience. Months ten through twelve: practice, competition, refinement.

**PLATO:** And at no point in this curriculum does the student encounter the question: *what is true?*

**ARISTOTLE:** Truth emerges through the dialectical process itself —

**PLATO:** No. Truth is what the dialectical process *aims at*. Without that aim, you are simply training technicians of persuasion. Gorgias could argue any side. Protagoras could make the weaker argument stronger. They were *brilliant* and they were *dangerous*, because their skill was detached from wisdom. I would not teach argumentation at all. I would teach *philosophy* — the love of wisdom — and argumentation would emerge as its natural instrument.

My Academy did not have a rhetoric department. It had a sign above the door: *Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.* Because geometry teaches the mind to follow a proof wherever it leads, regardless of what you *want* to be true. That discipline — the discipline of following the argument — is what a debate program should cultivate. Not the ability to win. The ability to *follow*.

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** May I speak? I have governed an empire and commanded armies, and I can tell you that neither Aristotle's curriculum nor Plato's Academy addresses the thing that actually determines whether a person argues well or poorly in the moment of crisis.

**ARISTOTLE:** Which is?

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** *Their relationship to their own ego.*

I have sat in council with the finest minds in Rome. Senators trained in Greek rhetoric, philosophers of every school, generals who could read a battlefield like a text. And I have watched every one of them, at some crucial moment, abandon their own best reasoning because their pride was threatened. A man who has been publicly corrected will spend the rest of the debate trying to recover his dignity rather than trying to find the truth. A woman who has won three arguments in a row begins to believe she cannot be wrong and stops listening entirely.

Your curricula are excellent. But they address the *instrument* and ignore the *musician*. I would give equal time — genuinely equal, not as an afterthought — to what the Stoics call the *inner citadel*. The practice of distinguishing what is in your control from what is not. The discipline of assenting only to clear impressions and withholding judgment when impressions are unclear. Before every round of debate, my students would ask: "Am I seeking truth or seeking victory? And if I cannot tell the difference, I am not ready to speak."

**ARISTOTLE:** Marcus, I respect this deeply, but I must point out that you are describing *virtue*, and virtue without *competence* is merely good intentions. The kind-hearted senator who cannot construct a valid syllogism will lose every vote to the clever sophist who can. I would rather train competent people and hope for virtue than train virtuous people who are incompetent.

**PLATO:** And *I* would point out that this is a false dilemma. In the *Republic* I argued that genuine knowledge and genuine virtue are ultimately the same thing, because the person who truly understands justice *will be* just. The curriculum should aim at both simultaneously — not as separate tracks but as a single integrated formation of the soul.

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** Then perhaps we agree more than we think. My contribution is simply this: whatever we teach, we must attend explicitly to the student's *inner life*. The practice of self-examination, the habit of honest self-assessment, the courage to change one's mind publicly — these are not add-ons. They are the foundation. Everything else is technique.

## Afternoon: The Way of the Warrior

*A bare room. A wooden floor. Three men who have killed sit together.*

**MUSASHI:** I will begin, because my position is simple. You learn to fight by fighting. On the first day of my school, every student debates. They debate badly. Good. Now they know what they do not know. Everything after that is correcting errors revealed in combat.

**SUN TZU:** And how many students do you lose in that first week? The ones who are humiliated and never return?

**MUSASHI:** Those were not my students. They lacked the stomach for the Way.

**SUN TZU:** You speak like a duelist, Musashi. One man against one man. I think like a *general*. I am not building a single warrior — I am building an *army*. And an army requires intelligence-gathering before engagement, supply lines, morale, strategic patience. Your approach produces a few exceptional individuals and discards the rest. My approach produces a *force* — coordinated, informed, and positioned to win before the first engagement begins.

My program begins with reconnaissance. What are the formats? Who are the judges and what do they reward? Which schools are dominant and *why*? Where are the gaps in the competitive landscape that an underfunded program can exploit? You do not send soldiers into terrain you have not mapped.

**MUSASHI:** And while you are mapping, Sun Tzu, my students have already fought ten rounds and learned more than your maps will ever show them.

**TSUNETOMO:** *(who has been perfectly still)*

You are both wrong. And you are both wrong for the same reason.

**MUSASHI:** *(turns sharply)*

**TSUNETOMO:** Musashi, you fight to *win*. Sun Tzu, you strategize to *win*. The Way of the warrior is not winning. The Way of the warrior is *death*.

**SUN TZU:** Explain.

**TSUNETOMO:** In the *Hagakure* I wrote: "The Way of the warrior is death. This means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death." You both misunderstand this as literal. It is not about dying. It is about *the freedom that comes from having already died*.

The debater who is afraid to lose is already defeated. The debater who is calculating odds of victory, studying the terrain, positioning for advantage — this debater has a *self* to protect, and that self is a weakness. The debater who walks into the round having already accepted the worst possible outcome — total humiliation, complete defeat — this debater is *free*. Free to say what is actually true rather than what is safe. Free to take the dangerous argument, the unconventional position, the road no one else will walk.

My program would train students to *die* before they speak. Not physical death. The death of the ego that needs to win. The death of the reputation that needs to be maintained. The death of the fear that makes every debater, at the crucial moment, choose the safe argument over the true one.

**MUSASHI:** *(long silence)* ...You are not entirely wrong, Tsunetomo. When I fought Sasaki Kojirō at Ganryū Island, I arrived late. I carved my bokken from an oar on the boat. I broke every convention. I did this not from strategy but from *a place beyond caring about the outcome*. I had already decided. The decision was made before the duel.

**TSUNETOMO:** Yes. *That* is what I would teach. Not technique. Not strategy. *Resolve*. When a student has resolved completely, technique follows naturally, because there is no internal resistance disrupting the flow of action.

**SUN TZU:** I hear both of you, and I will concede this much: morale — which is what you are really describing, the warrior's relationship to fear and death — is the first of my five fundamental factors. It precedes terrain, weather, leadership, and doctrine. An army with perfect strategy and broken morale will lose every time. So perhaps... the *inner* work you describe, Tsunetomo, is the foundation upon which my strategic framework is built, rather than an alternative to it.

**MUSASHI:** Then we have something. Tsunetomo gives the spirit. I give the direct practice. Sun Tzu gives the strategic framework. Three elements of one Way.

**TSUNETOMO:** If you must systematize it, yes. But do not mistake the system for the Way.

# DAY TWO: *Cross-Faction Dialectic & The Guest Orators*

## Morning: The Factions Address Each Other

*All eight sages in a single hall. Plato moderates.*

**PLATO:** Yesterday each school clarified its internal position. Today we confront each other. I will name the central tension as I see it and invite challenge.

The Way of Stillness holds that the deepest teaching is indirect, that the best debate program barely looks like one, and that listening and beginner's mind are more fundamental than any technique.

The Academy holds that systematic intellectual formation is essential, though we disagree internally about whether the aim is competence, wisdom, or character — or whether these are finally separable.

The Way of the Warrior holds that direct experience, strategic intelligence, and a radical relationship to ego-death are the foundations of mastery.

The question for today: *Can these positions learn from each other, or are they genuinely incompatible?*

**ARISTOTLE:** I will open by granting something to the Warriors and something to the Contemplatives, and then I will challenge both. To Musashi and his school: you are correct that *practice* is irreplaceable. I wrote in the *Ethics* that we become builders by building and harpists by playing the harp. Virtue — and skill — are *hexis*, dispositions formed through repeated action, not through study alone. My curriculum must include practice from the beginning, not only at the end. I concede this.

To Suzuki and Laozi: you are correct that *receptivity* is undervalued. I have seen students so eager to deploy their techniques that they fail to hear what their opponent is actually saying. The practice of deep listening is genuinely foundational. But — and here is my challenge — neither of you has explained how a student *develops* from listening to speaking. The move from receptivity to articulation requires *craft*, and craft requires instruction. Beginner's mind is a beautiful starting point. It is not a sufficient endpoint.

**SUZUKI:** May I respond? Aristotle, you assume that the move from listening to speaking is a *development* — something added on top. In Zen, we would say it is a *subtraction*. The student already knows how to speak. What they do not know is how to stop the noise in their own mind long enough to speak from a genuine place rather than from anxiety and habit. Our practice does not *add* the capacity for articulation. It *removes the obstacles* to it.

**MUSASHI:** Beautiful. And useless. I have seen monks who sat in meditation for twenty years and could not defend themselves against a novice with a wooden sword. Removal of obstacles is not enough. The *body* must be trained. The reflexes must be sharpened. Suzuki, have you ever stood in front of an opponent who is faster and better prepared than you, with sixty seconds to respond to an argument you've never heard before? The silence of the zendo will not save you. Only *training* saves you.

**TSUNETOMO:** Musashi, you are closer to Suzuki than you realize. When you fought at Ganryū Island, you did not *think* your way through the duel. You moved from a place deeper than thought. What Suzuki calls beginner's mind and what I call the freedom of one who has already died — these are the same still point. The training you describe is real, but its purpose is to exhaust the conscious mind so that this deeper place can function unobstructed.

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** I want to name what I believe is the hidden agreement in this room. Every school represented here — Contemplative, Classical, Warrior — has some version of the same insight: *the ego is the primary obstacle*. Suzuki and Laozi approach it through stillness and non-attachment. Plato approaches it through the discipline of following the argument rather than defending your position. I approach it through Stoic self-examination. Tsunetomo approaches it through the radical acceptance of death. Even Aristotle, in his notion of *phronesis* — practical wisdom — describes a capacity that operates beyond mere cleverness, that requires a kind of self-transcendence.

We disagree about *method*. We agree about the *enemy*.

**LAOZI:** *(quietly)* The enemy that is named is already half-defeated. But only half.

## Afternoon: The Guest Orators

*The hall falls silent as two men enter from opposite doors. Cicero — Roman consul, master of Latin prose, executed for his defense of the Republic. Demosthenes — Athenian statesman, who overcame a speech impediment to become the voice that rallied Greece against Philip of Macedon, and who chose death by poison over surrender.*

*They have been asked to speak, in turn, on the question: What should a school of argumentation produce?*

**PLATO:** *(as moderator)* We have spent a day and a half among philosophers. We have discussed curricula, dispositions, emptiness, death, and the structure of the soul. Now I invite two men who did not merely theorize about rhetoric but *used it in the arena of history* — at the cost of their lives. Cicero of Arpinum. Demosthenes of Athens. The question before you: what should a school of argumentation produce?

---

**CICERO:**

Distinguished colleagues. I thank you for the invitation, though I confess some amusement at being called a "guest" in a conversation about rhetoric. I have *practiced* what you have *theorized*, and the practice nearly killed me before the sword finally did.

I have listened to your deliberations, and I wish to begin with a correction. Several of you speak as though rhetoric and truth are in tension — as though one must choose between persuasion and wisdom. This is the error of those who have never stood before a Senate in crisis.

When I rose to denounce Catiline, I was not choosing between truth and persuasion. The truth *was* that Catiline was plotting the destruction of the Republic. The challenge was not to discover the truth — it was to make the truth *felt* with sufficient force that men who were comfortable, complacent, and afraid would *act*. Truth without rhetoric is philosophy. Rhetoric without truth is sophistry. But truth *with* rhetoric — this is statesmanship.

What should your school produce? It should produce *orators* in the fullest Roman sense: men and women of learning, of moral seriousness, of civic commitment, who possess the art of making wisdom *persuasive*. This requires everything you have discussed — Aristotle's systematic training, yes, Marcus's attention to character, certainly, even something of what the contemplatives call listening. But above all, it requires what none of you have sufficiently emphasized: *style*. The architecture of a sentence. The rhythm of a period. The placement of a word that transforms understanding.

You think style is ornament. It is not. Style is *thought made audible*. When I arranged my Catilinarian orations in ascending periods, when I placed the accusation at the precise rhythmic apex, I was not decorating an argument. I was constructing an *experience* that made the argument undeniable.

Your school should train students who can do this. Not merely think clearly — think *beautifully*, because beauty in argument is not luxury. It is *force*.

---

**DEMOSTHENES:**

*(Stands. His voice is rougher than Cicero's. Less polished. More direct.)*

Cicero speaks of making truth beautiful. I have no quarrel with beauty. But I did not come here to discuss beauty.

When I was a boy, I could not speak clearly. My tongue would not obey me. I put pebbles in my mouth and shouted over the waves until the words came clean. I tell you this not for sympathy but because it taught me the first lesson of rhetoric: *it does not matter how well you speak if no one acts on what you say.*

Cicero is right that his Catilinarian orations were masterful. Rome *applauded* them. And then Rome, over the course of a generation, handed itself to tyrants anyway. The Senate that cheered Cicero's eloquence lacked the will to preserve what his eloquence defended. "How well he spoke," they said. And then they did nothing.

When Philip of Macedon moved against Greece, I did not give Rome beautiful speeches. I went to the Athenian assembly and I said: Philip is coming. He will take your freedom. He will enslave your children. *What are you going to do about it?* And they marched.

They marched and they *lost* — at Chaeronea, against Philip's phalanx. I will not hide this. The result was defeat. But the question of rhetoric is not whether you win. The question is whether you *move people from deliberation to action*. Whether your words enter the hearer's body and become *will*.

What should your school produce? Not people who speak well. People who speak in a way that *changes what happens next*. The test of your graduates is not whether judges give them high marks. The test is whether, ten years after leaving your program, they stand up in the room where a decision is being made and *the decision changes because they spoke*.

This requires everything the Warriors discussed — the willingness to put yourself at risk, the radical commitment Tsunetomo describes. It requires what Marcus demands — genuine conviction, not performance. And it requires what Cicero will not say plainly: the willingness to be *ugly* in your speech if ugliness is what the moment demands. I did not always speak with beautiful periods. Sometimes I shouted. Sometimes I wept. Sometimes I pounded the rostrum until my hands bled, because the situation *demanded* that my body show what my words alone could not convey.

Your school should make students *dangerous*. Not clever. Not eloquent. Not balanced. *Dangerous* — to complacency, to injustice, to the comfortable lies that allow suffering to continue.

*That* is what rhetoric is for.

---

*Silence in the hall.*

**MUSASHI:** *(to Tsunetomo, quietly)* That one has the spirit of the warrior.

**TSUNETOMO:** *(nods)* He has already died. You can hear it in his voice.

**SUZUKI:** *(to Laozi)* And yet notice — he trained with pebbles in his mouth. Even the most genuine spirit requires practice.

**LAOZI:** The wave does not rehearse before it breaks against the shore. But it needed the whole ocean behind it.

---

**PLATO:** *(as moderator)* We have heard two visions. Cicero says a school of argumentation should produce *orators* — people whose skill makes truth persuasive and whose style is inseparable from their thought. Demosthenes says it should produce *agents of action* — people whose speech moves others from deliberation to decision, even at personal cost.

I note that these are not the same thing, and the difference between them may be the deepest question we face.

---

## Evening: Response and Reckoning

*Open discussion. Marcus Aurelius moderates the evening session.*

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** We have been given a great gift by our guests. They have shown us that the question "what should a debate program produce?" is not an academic question. Both men paid for their rhetoric with their lives. Cicero was proscribed by Antony and killed by soldiers. Demosthenes took poison rather than surrender to Antipater. This is not a game we are designing.

I would like each faction to respond briefly to what they heard, and particularly to the distinction between Cicero's vision and Demosthenes' vision.

**ARISTOTLE:** I will respond honestly: Demosthenes shook me. I have spent my career systematizing the tools of persuasion, and I have perhaps given insufficient attention to the question of what those tools are *for*. Cicero is closer to my instinct — he values training, system, craft. But Demosthenes is asking whether craft without *urgency* produces anything that matters. I must sit with this.

**SUZUKI:** Demosthenes spoke from what we call *hara* — the center of the body. Not from the mind. His rhetoric is not technique; it is *being*. This is closer to our school's understanding than anything else we have heard. But I would caution: the energy Demosthenes channels is also dangerous. The speech that moves people to march can move them to march *in the wrong direction*. Beginner's mind is not just for the speaker. It is for the listener. A school must train people who can *hear* a Demosthenes and still ask: is this true? Or am I simply being moved?

**SUN TZU:** I found myself taking notes during both speeches, which I suppose reveals my nature. Cicero described the art of *positioning* — placing the right word at the right moment, understanding audience, constructing an architecture of persuasion. This is strategy. Demosthenes described the art of *commitment* — total investment of self in the act of speech, willingness to fail, willingness to die. This is morale. My system requires both. The general who has perfect strategy and no morale commands an army that will not fight. The general who has perfect morale and no strategy leads a magnificent charge into a ravine.

**TSUNETOMO:** Demosthenes understood death. Cicero understood life. A complete school needs both. But if I must choose — and in the moment of action, one always must choose — I choose the one who has already accepted the worst. Demosthenes with pebbles in his mouth, shouting over the sea, is the image of the warrior in training. Not because the pebbles are a good technique. Because the boy who does that has *decided*. The decision precedes everything.

**LAOZI:** *(after a long pause)*

Cicero built a dam. Demosthenes *was* the flood.

A dam is useful. It controls, directs, stores power for later. But when the dam breaks — and dams always break — it is the water that remains.

I would teach my students to be water. But I admit, after hearing these two men, that water sometimes needs to be *hot*.

---

**MARCUS AURELIUS:** *(closing the day)*

We have arrived at something. Let me try to name it.

A school of argumentation must do at least four things, and no single tradition in this room does all four:

It must train the **mind** — Aristotle's contribution. Logic, structure, the tools of thought.

It must train the **perception** — Suzuki and Laozi's contribution. The capacity to listen deeply, to approach each encounter with openness, to see what is actually present rather than what you expect.

It must train the **character** — my own tradition's emphasis, shared in different ways by Plato and Tsunetomo. The courage to follow truth, the equanimity to handle defeat, the freedom that comes from releasing attachment to outcome.

And it must train the **will to act** — Demosthenes' challenge, Musashi's insistence on practice, Sun Tzu's strategic commitment. The capacity to move from understanding to *doing something about it*.

Any program that cultivates only one of these produces something incomplete. The question for tomorrow is whether each of us, informed by what we've heard, can design a *complete* program that remains true to our own tradition while honestly incorporating what we've learned from the others.

# DAY THREE: *Final Positions*

*Morning. Each faction presents its refined position, acknowledging what they've absorbed from the dialectic.*
