# The Symposium on the School of Argumentation
## Proceedings & Program Blueprints

*Three factions and two guest orators answer the question: How would you build a debate program from nothing over twelve continuous months at a university — with no budget and no institutional support?*

---

## A Note on Structure

Each blueprint follows from the philosophical commitments of its authors, shaped by three days of vigorous dialectic. They are not variations on a single template. They are genuinely different answers to what a school of argumentation *is for*, which produces genuinely different structures, timelines, and measures of success.

The reader should attend not only to what each program includes but to what it *omits* — the omissions reveal the philosophical commitments as clearly as the inclusions.

# I. THE WAY OF STILLNESS
### A Program in Receptive Inquiry
*Laozi & Shunryu Suzuki*

**Core Thesis:** The deepest argumentation emerges from the deepest listening. Most of what passes for debate training is the accumulation of techniques that obstruct genuine understanding. The program that teaches least explicitly teaches most profoundly.

**Governing Metaphor:** Water. It takes the shape of whatever contains it. It yields to every force. And it carved the Grand Canyon.

---

### Phase One: Emptying the Cup (Months 1–3)
*"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind there are few."*

**The Only Activity:** Structured listening practice within the professor's existing courses.

Students are paired. One speaks for five uninterrupted minutes on a topic they care about. The other listens — not to respond, not to evaluate, not to formulate a rebuttal — simply to *hear*. Then the listener must restate what was said to the speaker's satisfaction before offering any response. If the speaker says "no, that's not what I meant," the listener tries again.

This is repeated weekly. No argumentation theory is introduced. No terminology is taught. The professor observes who begins to change — who starts hearing what is actually being said rather than what they expected to hear. These students are invited to continue.

**What Is NOT Done:** No reading assignments. No lecture on argument structure. No competitive framing of any kind. The cup must be emptied before it can be filled.

**The Paradox the Professor Must Embody:** You are "doing nothing" that looks productive to an outside observer. You are building the most important capacity your students will ever develop.

### Phase Two: The Container Emerges (Months 4–6)
*"Thirty spokes share the hub of a wheel; it is the empty center that makes the wheel useful."*

**Weekly Gathering:** A regular meeting time and place are established — not as a "club" but as a *practice space*. Suzuki's contribution: minimal but precise form. Students sit in a circle. There is a ritual of beginning (a moment of silence) and a ritual of closing (each person names one thing they heard that changed their thinking). Between these bookends, the form is open.

**The Practice:** One person makes a claim about something that genuinely matters to them. Not a debate resolution — a *belief they hold*. The group's task is not to attack or defend but to *explore* — to ask questions that help the speaker discover what they actually think, including the parts they haven't examined. This is closer to Socratic elenchus than to competitive debate, but without the Socratic agenda. The group genuinely does not know where the inquiry will lead.

**Introducing Disagreement — Indirectly:** The professor begins selecting pairings where genuine disagreement exists. Not manufactured opposition — real intellectual difference. The form teaches students to stay present with disagreement without collapsing into either combat or avoidance. They learn that the uncomfortable space *between* positions is where insight lives.

**What Emerges Naturally:** Students begin to develop the habits that debate programs usually try to teach through drills — careful listening, precise articulation, the ability to identify the core of an argument, comfort with silence and uncertainty. But these habits emerge from practice rather than instruction, which means they are rooted more deeply.

### Phase Three: The Water Finds Its Course (Months 7–9)
*"The Tao does nothing, and yet nothing is left undone."*

**The Question of Competition:** The professor does not introduce competition. If students discover the existence of debate tournaments and express interest, the professor supports this — but as *their* initiative, not the professor's agenda. If they do not discover tournaments, the program continues without them and is no less valuable.

**If Students Choose to Compete:** The preparation is simple. The group practices what it has been practicing — deep listening, genuine inquiry, comfort with not-knowing — but now with an awareness that they will encounter opponents operating from a completely different paradigm. The professor's guidance: "You will meet people who are faster, louder, and more technically skilled than you. Your advantage is that you can actually hear what they are saying, and they probably cannot hear what you are saying. Stay in your practice."

**If Students Do Not Compete:** The gathering deepens. Topics become more complex. Students begin bringing genuine intellectual problems from their coursework and lives. The practice space becomes what Suzuki's zendo was — a place people come to because the quality of attention is different from anywhere else on campus.

**Public Expression:** One public event — an open inquiry session on a campus issue, conducted in the circle format. This is not a "debate showcase." It is a demonstration that a different mode of public discourse is possible. Faculty and students who attend are often surprised. Some are drawn in.

### Phase Four: Roots and Water (Months 10–12)
*"The best leader is one whose existence is barely known."*

**Transmission:** The professor begins to withdraw. Not from neglect but from the recognition that the community must become self-sustaining. Senior students begin facilitating sessions. The professor attends but speaks less and less. The question is whether the quality of attention persists when the original teacher is not directing it. If it does, the program is real. If it does not, it was always just the professor's presence, and the honest response is to accept this.

**Institutional Positioning:** Student organization status is sought — not for legitimacy but for practical access to rooms and minimal funding. The framing is not "debate team" but something closer to "inquiry practice" or "contemplative dialogue." This is not marketing strategy; it is accurate description.

**Year-End Measure of Success:** Not trophies or tournament records. The measure is: *Do students think differently than they did twelve months ago?* Do they listen before speaking? Do they sit with discomfort rather than rushing to resolution? Can they hold a genuine disagreement with another human being without either capitulating or attacking? If yes, the program has succeeded regardless of any external metric.

### What This Program Produces
People who can be present in a room where disagreement is happening without needing to win, flee, or perform. People whose first instinct when encountering an opposing view is curiosity rather than defense. People who have discovered that the most powerful thing you can do in an argument is *actually hear what the other person is saying*.

### What This Program Does NOT Produce
Competitive debaters, in the conventional sense. Students trained in this tradition may struggle in formats that reward speed, aggression, and technical proficiency. They may also, in a longer timeframe, become the most formidable arguers in any room — because the person who can actually hear you is the person you cannot defeat.

# II. THE ACADEMY
### A Program in Systematic Formation
*Aristotle, Plato, & Marcus Aurelius*

**Core Thesis:** The capacity for rigorous argumentation is an *excellence* (aretē) that requires systematic cultivation across three domains: the intellect (Aristotle), the orientation toward truth (Plato), and the character of the practitioner (Marcus Aurelius). A program that trains only one of these produces either clever sophists, impractical idealists, or well-intentioned incompetents.

**Governing Metaphor:** The gymnasium. The Greeks trained body and mind in the same space because they understood that excellence is *cultivated through structured practice under the guidance of those who have achieved it*. A debate program is an intellectual gymnasium.

---

### Term I: Foundations (Months 1–4)
*"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." — Aristotle*

**Month 1 — The Organon (Tools of Thought)**
Within existing courses, the professor introduces the basic architecture of reasoning. Not as "debate theory" but as the grammar of clear thinking. Claim, warrant, impact. Valid versus sound. Necessary versus sufficient conditions. The categorical syllogism. Students practice identifying argument structures in texts they are already reading. Weekly exercises: given a passage, extract the argument. Given a conclusion, construct the argument. Given an argument, identify the weakest link.

*Marcus Aurelius's Addition:* Each week begins with a brief reflection exercise. Students write three sentences: "What do I believe about this topic? Why do I believe it? What would change my mind?" This is not journaling. It is the Stoic practice of *prosoche* — attention to one's own mental states — applied to intellectual life.

**Month 2 — The Topoi (Places of Argument)**
Introduction to Aristotle's *Topics*: the common patterns from which arguments are generated. Definition, comparison, cause and effect, testimony, analogy. Students learn not just to analyze arguments but to *generate* them — to look at a question and see the multiple angles from which it can be approached. Practice format: given a resolution, generate arguments from at least four distinct topoi within ten minutes.

*Plato's Addition:* Alongside the generative exercises, students practice *elenchus* — Socratic cross-examination. In pairs, one student makes a claim. The other asks questions — only questions — designed to test the consistency and foundations of the claim. The goal is not refutation but *clarification*. Students learn that the most powerful move in argument is often a precise question rather than a devastating rebuttal.

**Month 3 — Rhetoric Proper**
The three modes of persuasion: ethos (character), pathos (emotion), logos (reason). Students analyze examples from Cicero, Demosthenes, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and contemporary speakers. They learn that persuasion is not manipulation — it is the art of making what is true *accessible* to a particular audience. Practice format: deliver the same argument to three different audiences (a panel of experts, a general public audience, a hostile audience) and adapt accordingly.

*Marcus Aurelius's Addition:* After each practice speech, the student answers: "Where did I speak from genuine conviction? Where did I perform? Could I tell the difference?" The Stoic debater must develop the capacity for *honest self-assessment* — not self-criticism, but accurate self-knowledge.

**Month 4 — Integration and First Engagement**
Full practice debates in a structured format (parliamentary or public forum). But with a crucial addition: after each round, a formal *debrief* that addresses three questions. Aristotle's question: "Was the argument well-constructed?" Plato's question: "Did the argument pursue truth or merely victory?" Marcus's question: "How did you handle the moments of pressure — when your position was attacked, when you were losing, when you were tempted to distort?"

Student organization officially formed. Officers elected. Constitution adopted. The institutional infrastructure is modest but real.

### Term II: Deepening (Months 5–8)
*"The myth of the cave describes not a place but a process." — Plato*

**Month 5 — The First Tournament**
Strategic selection of an accessible, low-stakes tournament within driving distance. Parliamentary or public debate format preferred for accessibility. The purpose is not to win — it is to *encounter the competitive landscape* and discover what competitive argumentation actually demands.

Pre-tournament: Sun Tzu's influence is acknowledged here — basic competitive intelligence. What formats? What judging criteria? What do successful programs do? This is not Aristotle's instinct (he would prefer to train and trust the training), but the symposium's dialectic has convinced him that preparation includes understanding the terrain.

Post-tournament: Extended debrief. Results are secondary. The primary questions: What surprised you? What did you encounter that our training did not prepare you for? Where did your character fail you before your technique did?

**Months 6–7 — The Dialectical Core**
This is the heart of the Academy's program: rigorous engagement with genuinely difficult questions. Students read primary philosophical texts — not as academic exercises but as *positions to be defended and attacked*. Format: structured dialectic with rotating roles. Every student must argue positions they disagree with. Every student must subject their own deepest convictions to cross-examination.

Plato's emphasis dominates this phase: the goal is to develop the *courage to follow the argument wherever it leads*, even when it leads to uncomfortable conclusions. Students discover that intellectual honesty is a form of bravery.

Marcus Aurelius's contribution: regular "premeditation" exercises. Before each session, students sit with the question: "What is the strongest argument against what I believe?" The Stoic practice of *premeditatio malorum* (premeditation of adversity) adapted for intellectual life. A debater who has honestly confronted the best case against their position is almost impossible to surprise.

**Month 8 — The Art of Changing Your Mind**
A session devoted entirely to intellectual humility. Each student must identify a belief they held at the beginning of the year that they no longer hold, explain what changed their mind, and articulate what this experience taught them about the nature of conviction.

This is the Academy's distinctive contribution. No other faction in the symposium emphasizes this capacity, but the Academy holds it to be the highest mark of intellectual maturity. The debater who can change their mind publicly, without shame, in response to good argument — this debater has achieved something more important than any trophy.

### Term III: Mastery and Transmission (Months 9–12)
*"Waste no more time arguing about what a good person should be. Be one." — Marcus Aurelius*

**Months 9–10 — Competitive Season**
Multiple tournaments. Students now have both the technical skill (Aristotle), the truth-seeking orientation (Plato), and the inner stability (Marcus) to compete meaningfully. Results improve naturally because the foundation is comprehensive.

Between tournaments, continued practice with increasing sophistication. Advanced argument theory: the *enthymeme* (argument from probability), the *paradigm* (argument from example), refutation strategies, the architecture of the constructive speech.

**Month 11 — Public Contribution**
A major public event: a structured debate or symposium on a topic of genuine campus significance. Faculty from multiple departments invited to judge and participate. Media coverage sought. This serves a dual purpose: it demonstrates the program's value to the institution, and it fulfills the program's civic mission — training students who contribute to public discourse, not just competitive performance.

Additionally: a formal proposal to the administration for institutional recognition and a course proposal (1-credit practicum in argumentation and critical thinking). The Academy understands that institutional sustainability requires *institutional integration*.

**Month 12 — The Succession**
Senior students trained as mentors for the next cohort. Documentation of curriculum, exercises, and practices. A written "handbook" that captures not just what the program does but *why*. Officer transition.

The Academy's year-end assessment asks three questions: Can the student construct a valid argument? (Aristotle) Can the student follow the argument to truth rather than to victory? (Plato) Can the student maintain equanimity, honesty, and courage under the pressure of live intellectual combat? (Marcus Aurelius)

If the answer to all three is yes, the Academy has fulfilled its purpose.

### What This Program Produces
Practitioners of structured reasoning who possess both competitive skill and intellectual integrity. People who can win a debate round and then honestly assess whether the position they defended was correct. People who treat argumentation as a *civic art* — a contribution to the common good, not merely a personal accomplishment.

### What This Program Does NOT Produce
Spontaneous, intuitive arguers. Students from the Academy may initially struggle with formats that reward speed and improvisation over careful reasoning. They may also lack the radical ego-dissolution that the Contemplative and Warrior traditions cultivate, relying instead on disciplined self-management.

---

# III. THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR
### A Program in Strategic Mastery Through Direct Engagement
*Miyamoto Musashi, Sun Tzu, & Yamamoto Tsunetomo*

**Core Thesis:** Argumentation is combat. Not metaphorical combat — *actual combat*, in which real things are at stake: reputation, conviction, the right to be heard. A program that pretends otherwise produces practitioners who collapse at the first moment of genuine pressure. The Way of the Warrior trains through direct engagement, strategic intelligence, and the radical freedom that comes from releasing attachment to outcome.

**Governing Metaphor:** The dojo. You do not learn swordsmanship by studying swords. You learn it by picking one up and facing someone who is trying to cut you. Everything else — strategy, philosophy, inner work — serves the moment of engagement.

---

### Phase One: The Forging (Months 1–3)
*"The Way is in training." — Miyamoto Musashi*

**Week 1 — Combat Begins**
There is no orientation period. On the first day students are gathered, they debate. The format is simple: a resolution, two sides, seven minutes each, three minutes of cross-examination. The professor provides the resolution and the timer. Nothing else.

Students perform badly. This is expected and necessary. Musashi's principle: *you cannot know what you lack until you have been tested*. The experience of standing before an opponent with nothing but your own mind and discovering that your mind is not enough — this is the foundational experience of the program. Everything that follows is a response to this discovery.

**Weeks 2–12 — Kata and Correction**
Daily drills. (The Warriors' program meets more frequently than the other factions'.) Each drill targets a specific combat skill:

*Speed drills:* Thirty seconds to generate three arguments for any given resolution. Then fifteen seconds. Then ten. The conscious mind is too slow for live debate. The drills train the deeper processing that functions under pressure.

*Cross-examination drills:* Pairs practice asking questions designed to expose weaknesses. Students learn that cross-examination is not interrogation — it is *controlled demolition*. You must know exactly which load-bearing beam to strike.

*Flowing drills:* Students practice real-time note-taking during practice speeches. Flowing is the warrior's awareness — the capacity to track the entire battlefield simultaneously.

*Refutation drills:* Given an argument, destroy it in sixty seconds. Then build a new argument in its place. The warrior does not merely block the opponent's strike — they counter in the same motion.

**Sun Tzu's Contribution — Intelligence:**
Concurrent with daily drills, the program conducts systematic reconnaissance. Sun Tzu's five factors, adapted: What are the competitive formats and their scoring criteria? (Terrain.) What is the current competitive season and calendar? (Weather/Timing.) Who are the dominant programs and what makes them dominant? (Enemy strength.) What are our specific advantages and disadvantages? (Self-knowledge.) What is the morale and commitment level of our team? (Moral force.)

This intelligence shapes everything: which tournaments to enter, which formats to prioritize, which opponents to study.

**Tsunetomo's Contribution — The Practice of Dying:**
Before every practice round, a brief exercise. Students close their eyes and visualize the worst possible outcome: total humiliation, every argument destroyed, the judge openly contemptuous. They sit with this image until the emotional charge dissipates. Then they open their eyes and begin.

This is the *Hagakure* practice adapted for argumentation. The debater who has *already accepted defeat* before the round begins is paradoxically the most dangerous debater in the room, because they have nothing to protect. They are free to take risks, to make the unconventional argument, to go where the safe debater will not go.

### Phase Two: The Campaign (Months 4–7)
*"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war." — Sun Tzu*

**Month 4 — First Tournament**
The Warriors compete early — earlier than any other faction would recommend. Sun Tzu selects the tournament strategically (a smaller event where intelligence suggests favorable matchups), but Musashi insists that the selection not be *too* safe. The point is to encounter real opponents, not to manufacture easy wins.

Every round is recorded (audio or video if possible, detailed flows at minimum). Post-tournament analysis is exhaustive. Not just "what went wrong" but "what patterns do we see?" Sun Tzu's framework: every loss reveals information. A loss is only wasted if the information is not extracted.

**Months 5–6 — Adaptive Training**
Training shifts based on tournament intelligence. If cross-examination was the weakness, cross-examination drills intensify. If speed was the problem, speed drills increase. If composure broke under pressure, Tsunetomo's practices deepen. The program adapts like a military campaign adapts — constantly adjusting tactics based on contact with the enemy.

New students are recruited, but selectively. Musashi's criterion: "Do they have the stomach for it?" Sun Tzu's criterion: "Can they be trained?" Tsunetomo's criterion: "Are they willing to fail completely?" Students who meet all three criteria are integrated immediately into daily practice. There is no "beginner" track. New recruits spar with experienced members from day one, as Musashi learned by fighting experienced swordsmen while barely more than a child.

**Month 7 — The Art of the Strategem**
Advanced strategic training. Students learn to read opponents in real time — identifying their patterns, their comfort zones, their breaking points. Sun Tzu's teaching: "Know your enemy and know yourself, and in a hundred battles you will never be in peril."

Practice rounds now include explicit strategic constraints: "Win this round without using your strongest argument." "Concede your opponent's best point and still win." "Argue the position you believe is wrong and commit to it fully." These exercises develop flexibility — the capacity to fight from any position, with any weapon, on any terrain.

### Phase Three: Dominance and Legacy (Months 8–12)
*"The Way of the warrior is death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily." — Tsunetomo*

**Months 8–10 — Full Competitive Season**
Multiple tournaments, escalating in difficulty. The program now has a reputation — small, aggressive, unpredictable. Sun Tzu's positioning has created strategic advantages: the team competes in formats where their strengths align with judging criteria, avoids formats that expose weaknesses (until those weaknesses are addressed), and studies specific opponents before key matchups.

Between tournaments, training does not slow — it intensifies. Musashi's principle: the warrior who rests between battles dulls. The competitive season is not a departure from training; it *is* the training.

**Month 11 — The Challenge Round**
A distinctive event: the program hosts an open challenge. Any student on campus can come and debate a member of the team on any topic. The team member must accept whatever topic is proposed and argue whatever side is assigned.

This serves Musashi's purpose (the warrior must be ready for any challenge), Sun Tzu's purpose (it demonstrates strength and recruits from the broader student body), and Tsunetomo's purpose (it is a public practice of the willingness to be defeated — the team member who loses to an untrained challenger and handles it with grace has demonstrated the deepest warrior virtue).

**Month 12 — Transmission of the Way**
The most experienced students become teachers. But in the Warrior tradition, teaching is not lecturing — it is *sparring*. Senior students run drills, judge practice rounds, and most importantly, *serve as opponents*. The best training partner is the one who is better than you and committed to making you better by defeating you.

Documentation in the Warrior tradition is minimal and practical: a playbook of strategies, a database of opponent tendencies, a drill manual. The knowledge lives in the *practice*, not in the texts.

Sun Tzu's year-end assessment: competitive record, strategic positioning, intelligence database.
Musashi's year-end assessment: can the student handle any opponent, any format, any topic, on any given day?
Tsunetomo's year-end assessment: has the student achieved *freedom from the fear of defeat*? Do they walk into the round already at peace with any outcome?

### What This Program Produces
Competitors. People who can walk into a high-pressure environment and perform at their peak. Strategists who understand the landscape and position themselves to win. And — if Tsunetomo's teaching has taken root — warriors who fight with total commitment and zero attachment, which makes them both formidable and, paradoxically, gracious.

### What This Program Does NOT Produce
Philosophers. The Warrior program does not spend significant time on questions of truth, meaning, or the ultimate purpose of argumentation. It assumes that the purpose is *mastery*, and that mastery reveals its own meaning through practice. Students may develop extraordinary competitive skill while remaining unreflective about what that skill is for. The Academy and the Contemplatives would consider this a serious deficiency.

---

# IV. THE CICERONIAN PROGRAM
### A Program in the Complete Orator
*Marcus Tullius Cicero*

**Core Thesis:** The orator is not a specialist in argument. The orator is the person of wide learning, moral seriousness, and rhetorical mastery who can make wisdom persuasive in the civic arena. The school of argumentation exists to produce citizens capable of shaping public life through the power of articulate thought.

**Governing Metaphor:** The Forum. All roads lead to the place where decisions are made. Every skill, every discipline, every exercise exists to prepare the student for the moment when they must stand before an audience that matters and speak in a way that changes the outcome.

---

### The Twelve Months

**Months 1–2: The Liberal Foundation**
Cicero's orator is not narrowly trained. "The complete orator must be versed in every liberal art." Students read widely — philosophy, history, law, literature, science — not as specializations but as *material*. The debater who knows only debate is the debater who runs out of things to say by round three. Weekly practice: take a concept from any discipline and explain it, persuasively, to an audience that knows nothing about it. This cultivates the habit of making the complex accessible — the foundation of all public eloquence.

Simultaneously: voice and delivery training. Cicero considered *actio* (delivery) the most powerful of rhetoric's five canons. Students practice projection, pacing, the use of silence, the management of physical presence. They learn that *how* you say something is not separate from *what* you say — it is part of what you say.

**Months 3–4: The Five Canons**
Systematic instruction in the classical rhetorical framework:
*Inventio* — discovering what to say (argument generation, research methods, the identification of the available means of persuasion).
*Dispositio* — arranging it effectively (speech structure, the architecture of a case, the strategic ordering of arguments).
*Elocutio* — expressing it with style (word choice, figurative language, the sentence as a unit of meaning and rhythm).
*Memoria* — the trained memory (techniques for speaking without notes, the internalization of arguments so they can be deployed fluidly).
*Actio* — delivering it with presence (everything from gesture to vocal modulation to the strategic use of silence and space).

Each canon receives dedicated practice. Students present the same core argument five times, each time focusing on a different canon. They discover that an argument transformed by *style* is not the same argument decorated — it is a *different and more powerful* argument.

**Months 5–7: Competitive Practice and Rhetorical Analysis**
Debate practice intensifies, but with a Ciceronian emphasis: *every round is a speech, and every speech is a performance*. Students are evaluated not only on the logic of their arguments but on the artistry of their expression. Can you turn a phrase that the judge remembers? Can you construct a period that builds to an inevitable conclusion? Can you use *humor* — the most dangerous and powerful weapon in the orator's arsenal?

Concurrent study of great speeches across history. Students analyze not just what was argued but *how* — the structural choices, the stylistic signatures, the moments where the speaker did something surprising and why it worked. The goal is to develop *taste* — the intuitive sense for what is excellent in public speech.

First tournaments in months 6–7. Cicero's criterion for readiness: the student must be able to speak on any topic, to any audience, for any length of time, and hold attention throughout. If they cannot, more preparation is needed.

**Months 8–10: The Civic Turn**
The program turns outward. Students engage in public speaking beyond the tournament circuit — campus government, community forums, public advocacy for causes they believe in. Cicero's conviction: rhetoric is not an academic exercise. It is a civic art. The test of the orator is not the tournament round but the *consequential speech* — the speech that changes what happens in the world.

Students mentor younger speakers. The Ciceronian model of education is inherently hierarchical — the more accomplished teach the less accomplished — but the hierarchy is based on *demonstrated excellence*, not seniority. A second-semester student who speaks brilliantly mentors a third-semester student who does not.

**Months 11–12: The Complete Orator**
Capstone public event: each student delivers a major address (10–15 minutes) on a topic of their choosing to a public audience. Faculty, community members, and fellow students attend. This is the Ciceronian final examination — not a debate but an *oration*. Can the student stand alone before an audience, without an opponent to react to, and hold them through the power of thought expressed with art?

Institutional advocacy: formal proposal for a rhetoric course, program recognition, and modest funding. Cicero understands institutions. He was a politician. The proposal is written as Cicero would write it — with attention to what the audience (administration) values and needs to hear.

### What This Program Produces
Eloquent, learned, publicly effective speakers who treat rhetoric as an art form and a civic responsibility. People who can walk into any room and command attention through the quality of their thought and the power of their expression.

### What This Program Does NOT Produce
People who are comfortable with silence. The Ciceronian tradition values *fluency*, and fluency can become a kind of compulsion — the inability to not-speak. The Contemplatives would note that Cicero's orator may be the last person in the room to hear something important, because they are always preparing what to say next.

---

# V. THE DEMOSTHENIC PROGRAM
### A Program in Dangerous Speech
*Demosthenes of Athens*

**Core Thesis:** The purpose of rhetoric is not beauty, not victory, not even truth in the abstract. The purpose of rhetoric is to *move people to act when action is necessary*. The school of argumentation exists to produce people who are dangerous — dangerous to complacency, to injustice, to the comfortable silences that allow suffering to persist. The test of the graduate is simple: when they speak, does something *change*?

**Governing Metaphor:** Pebbles in the mouth, waves crashing. The boy who cannot speak clearly but will not stop trying until the sea itself becomes his teacher. Mastery born from desperation, refined by relentless practice, and deployed with absolute commitment.

---

### The Twelve Months

**Months 1–2: Finding the Fire**
Demosthenes does not begin with technique. He begins with *conviction*. Each student must identify something they believe is genuinely wrong in the world — not a debate topic, not an academic exercise, a *real injustice* they have witnessed or experienced. Something that makes them angry. Something that makes them unable to sleep.

This is the raw material. Without it, everything that follows is performance. Demosthenes' own oratory was powered by a genuine and desperate love for Athenian freedom. He spoke not because he was skilled but because he *could not remain silent*. The program must find this fire in each student or acknowledge that the student is not yet ready.

Weekly practice: stand before the group and speak about what you care about. No notes. No structure. No time limit. Just *speak*. The professor and fellow students offer no critique of technique — only the question: "Did I feel it? Did your words enter my body or only my ears?"

**Months 3–4: The Forge**
Now technique — but technique understood as the *instrument of conviction*, not its replacement.

Delivery becomes primary. Demosthenes famously trained by speaking with pebbles in his mouth, by declaiming while running uphill, by rehearsing before a mirror. The modern equivalent: students practice speaking in hostile conditions. In loud rooms. To distracted audiences. While physically uncomfortable. While being interrupted. They learn that the power to hold attention is not given by the audience — it is *taken* by the speaker through sheer force of presence and commitment.

Argument construction serves delivery: students learn to build arguments that *escalate* — that begin with a reasonable premise and build, through logical and emotional intensification, to a conclusion that demands action. The structure is not the balanced period of Cicero but the *crescendo* — the argument that arrives somewhere the listener did not expect to go but cannot deny having been taken.

**Months 5–7: Into the Arena**
Early and frequent competition, but with a difference: Demosthenes evaluates performance by a criterion no tournament uses. After every round, the question is not "did you win?" but "if the judge had been a citizen rather than a judge, would they have *done something* as a result of your speech?"

Between tournaments, students engage with real-world advocacy. They attend city council meetings, campus governance sessions, community forums — not as observers but as *speakers*. They learn that the tournament round is a simulation. The real arena is any room where a decision is being made and the outcome matters.

Students study not only great speeches but great *moments of persuasion* — the instances in history where someone spoke and the world shifted. They analyze not just the words but the *situation*: why was this audience ready to be moved? What was the speaker willing to risk? What made this speech different from the thousand competent speeches that changed nothing?

**Months 8–10: The Cost of Speaking**
Demosthenes' program confronts what others avoid: *rhetoric has consequences*. Demosthenes was exiled. Cicero was murdered. Frederick Douglass was beaten. Malala was shot. The person who speaks truth to power discovers that power responds.

Students study the *costs* of public speech — not to frighten them but to ensure they understand what they are training for. The question is not "can you give a good speech?" but "can you give a speech that matters, knowing that it may cost you something?"

Practice becomes more demanding. Students argue positions that are unpopular on their campus — not for the sake of controversy but for the practice of standing alone. They learn what it feels like to say something true when the room does not want to hear it. This is the Demosthenic version of Tsunetomo's "practice of dying" — you discover who you are when the audience turns hostile and you keep speaking anyway.

**Months 11–12: Legacy and Action**
The capstone is not a speech but a *campaign*. Each student identifies a concrete change they want to make — on campus, in their community, in their field — and uses every rhetorical skill they have developed to pursue it. They write op-eds. They address governing bodies. They organize. They *act*.

The program's year-end assessment: did any student's advocacy *change an outcome*? Did any speech result in a policy change, a resource allocation, a shifted institutional priority, a community mobilization? If yes — even once — the program has justified its existence. If no, the program was merely educational, and Demosthenes would consider this a failure.

Institutional sustainability: Demosthenes cares less about institutional approval than any other faction. If the university supports the program, good. If not, the program continues regardless, because the students who have found their fire do not need permission to speak.

### What This Program Produces
Advocates. People who speak because they must, who have been trained to make their conviction persuasive, and who measure their success not by awards but by *impact*. People who are dangerous to every form of complacency and comfortable injustice.

### What This Program Does NOT Produce
Balanced, dispassionate analysts. The Demosthenic tradition deliberately cultivates *passion* as a rhetorical instrument, and passion can blind as easily as it illuminates. The Academy would worry that Demosthenes' graduates are powerful but potentially unwise. Suzuki would worry that they cannot hear their opponents. Sun Tzu would worry that they charge into battles they cannot win. These concerns are legitimate. Demosthenes would answer: the world does not suffer from an excess of passionate truth-tellers. It suffers from their absence.

# VI. INTERNAL FACTION DIFFERENCES
### Where the Allies Diverge

Each faction presented a unified blueprint, but the symposium's dialectic revealed significant internal tensions that would produce meaningfully different programs if each sage acted alone. These differences are not contradictions — they are *emphases* that reflect genuinely distinct understandings within shared traditions.

## Within the Way of Stillness: Laozi vs. Suzuki

**The Core Tension:** Form versus Formlessness.

Laozi's solo program would have *even less structure* than the joint blueprint suggests. He would resist the regular meeting time, the rituals of opening and closing, even the designation as a "program." His conviction is that any fixed form eventually becomes an obstacle — the structure that was created to support inquiry becomes the thing that constrains it. Laozi's program might not survive twelve months as an identifiable entity, and he would not consider this a failure. The students it touched would carry the capacity for deep listening into every other context of their lives. The river does not need a name to flow.

Suzuki, by contrast, insists on *precise form as the container for formlessness*. In Zen, the rituals of the zendo — how you enter, how you sit, how you bow — are not arbitrary. They create the conditions within which something beyond form can emerge. Suzuki's solo program would have more structure than Laozi's: a specific sitting practice at the beginning of each session, formal protocols for dialogue, designated roles that rotate. He would argue that without this container, "formlessness" becomes mere sloppiness — and the students never develop the discipline that genuine openness requires.

**What this means practically:** Laozi's program risks dissipating. Suzuki's risks becoming a ritual that forgets its purpose. The joint blueprint attempts the middle path, but the tension is real and ongoing.

## Within the Academy: Aristotle vs. Plato vs. Marcus Aurelius

**The Core Tension:** A three-way disagreement about what is *primary*.

**Aristotle** believes competence is primary. His solo program would be the most rigorously structured: a sequential curriculum moving from logic through topics through rhetoric, with clear learning objectives, measurable outcomes, and systematic progression. He would use competitive results as evidence of program effectiveness. He would produce the most technically skilled debaters of any program in this symposium, and he would consider this sufficient. The character development Marcus emphasizes and the truth-seeking Plato demands are, for Aristotle, natural byproducts of excellent training — not separate goals requiring separate instruction.

**Plato** believes orientation toward truth is primary. His solo program would center on *philosophical inquiry*, with debate as a secondary instrument. Students would spend significantly more time reading primary texts, engaging in Socratic dialogue, and pursuing genuine questions than they would practicing competitive debate. Plato would resist tournaments entirely unless the format genuinely rewarded truth-seeking rather than victory-seeking. He would consider a program that produces tournament champions who cannot distinguish truth from persuasion to be a *moral failure*, regardless of its competitive success.

**Marcus Aurelius** believes character is primary. His solo program would dedicate substantial time — perhaps a third of every session — to what he calls "inner work": reflective journaling, exercises in equanimity, practices of self-examination, explicit discussion of the ethics of persuasion. His students might be less technically polished than Aristotle's and less philosophically sophisticated than Plato's, but they would be the most *reliable* — the ones you trust to argue honestly under pressure, to change their minds when the evidence demands it, and to treat opponents with genuine respect regardless of the competitive stakes. Marcus would consider this the hardest and most important skill to cultivate.

**What this means practically:** Aristotle's program wins more tournaments. Plato's program produces deeper thinkers. Marcus's program produces better human beings. The joint blueprint compromises, giving roughly equal weight to all three priorities, but each sage would argue that the compromise dilutes what matters most.

## Within the Way of the Warrior: Musashi vs. Sun Tzu vs. Tsunetomo

**The Core Tension:** Direct experience vs. strategic intelligence vs. spiritual freedom.

**Musashi's** solo program is the most brutal. Daily rounds from day one. No strategic calculation about which tournaments to enter — enter all of them. No preliminary intelligence-gathering — you learn the terrain by walking it. Musashi's program has the highest attrition rate and produces the smallest number of graduates, but those graduates are *forged*. They have been tested under every condition and have survived. Musashi would happily trade a large mediocre team for three exceptional warriors. He considers Sun Tzu's strategic approach a form of cowardice and Tsunetomo's inner work a form of delay.

**Sun Tzu's** solo program is the most calculated. Extensive pre-competitive research. Strategic selection of formats, tournaments, and even argument positions based on competitive analysis. Careful resource management — the program's limited budget and time are allocated based on expected competitive return. Sun Tzu's program would have the best competitive record relative to its resources, because every decision is optimized. He considers Musashi's approach wasteful (too many unnecessary losses) and Tsunetomo's approach irrelevant (inner peace is worthless if you lose every round).

**Tsunetomo's** solo program is the most radical. He would spend the first several months on nothing but the inner practice of releasing attachment to outcome. Students might not debate at all for weeks, instead engaging in exercises designed to confront and dissolve the ego's need for victory, recognition, and self-preservation. When they finally do compete, they compete with a freedom that is genuinely unnerving to opponents — because you cannot intimidate someone who has already accepted the worst possible outcome. Tsunetomo considers Musashi's program incomplete (direct experience without inner transformation just produces skilled egotists) and Sun Tzu's program spiritually empty (strategic optimization is sophisticated self-protection).

**What this means practically:** Musashi's program is the fastest to produce competent competitors but burns out many students. Sun Tzu's program is the most efficient but may produce strategists who lack genuine conviction. Tsunetomo's program is the slowest to show external results but produces the most resilient and psychologically free debaters. The joint blueprint sequences their contributions — Tsunetomo's spirit, Musashi's practice, Sun Tzu's strategy — but each sage would argue that his element should dominate, not merely participate.

## Cross-Cutting Insight

The deepest disagreement in the symposium is not between factions but *within* them — because people who share a tradition understand most precisely where they diverge. An Aristotelian and a Taoist may talk past each other productively. An Aristotelian and a Platonist must confront their disagreement directly, because they share enough vocabulary to know exactly what they are arguing about.

This insight applies to the building of any debate program: the most important conversations will not be between your program and your competitors. They will be *within your own coaching staff*, about what you are actually trying to do and why.

*End of Proceedings*

*The Symposium on the School of Argumentation was conducted over three days. These proceedings represent the refined positions of each faction following the dialectical process. They are offered not as a single recommendation but as five distinct and genuinely different answers to the question of what a school of argumentation should be — with the conviction that any program builder who takes all five seriously will construct something more complete than any single tradition could produce alone.*
