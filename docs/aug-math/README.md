# Augmented Intelligence: A Methodology Collection

> AI is not a replacement for mathematical thought. It is a **4D cognitive mirror** — reflecting your thinking across time, across domains you haven't visited, and across intellectual traditions you've never encountered. These documents codify how to use that mirror rigorously.

## The Three Documents

### 1. [`council-of-luminaries.md`](./council-of-luminaries.md)
**What it is:** A protocol for using AI to simulate councils of mathematical archetypes (Grothendieck, Noether, Tao, Riehl, and a mandatory Skeptic) to stress-test mathematical ideas during the exploration phase.

**When to use it:** When you have an intuition that might connect to existing mathematics and you need to map the conceptual territory before investing in formalization.

**What it produces:** A map — multiple precise formulations of your idea, a list of things to verify independently, and the sharpest version of the objection your idea hasn't yet answered.

---

### 2. [`bret-victor-pedagogical-stack.md`](./bret-victor-pedagogical-stack.md)
**What it is:** A methodology for building interactive mathematical essays where understanding is produced through manipulation, not transmission.

**When to use it:** When you want to make a mathematical concept accessible without sacrificing rigor — particularly for the domains where standard pedagogy has historically failed (algebraic topology, category theory, sheaf cohomology).

**What it produces:** An interactive essay where the reader arrives at the formal definition by having built the intuition that makes it inevitable.

---

### 3. [`braggoscope-pipeline.md`](./braggoscope-pipeline.md)
**What it is:** A semantic search and knowledge extraction pipeline for large technical corpora — surfacing the relevant existing work that the Council needs to stress-test against. Built on Matt Webb's inline chain-of-thought extraction technique from Braggoscope.

**When to use it:** Before a Council session, to map what territory your existing corpus already covers. After a Council session, to verify which items on the hypothesis list you've already partially addressed.

**What it produces:** A classified, entity-indexed, semantically searchable, cross-linked knowledge graph over your corpus.

### Supplementary Documents

**[`ANTI-PATTERNS.md`](./ANTI-PATTERNS.md)** — Nine failure modes drawn from real Council sessions, with enough specificity to recognize them before they happen. Includes: the Affirmation Spiral, the Jargon Cascade, the Hallucinated Citation, Philosopher's Drift, and the "Genuinely Novel" Trap.

**[`worked-example-council.md`](./worked-example-council.md)** — A complete Council session from scratch, annotated. Uses the three 2D algebras question (complex, split-complex, dual numbers as a one-parameter family) — requires only high school algebra. Read this before your first session.

## How They Relate

```
Braggoscope Pipeline        →    Council of Luminaries    →    Victor/Ciechanowski Stack
─────────────────────────        ──────────────────────        ───────────────────────
Surface relevant existing        Stress-test your idea         Translate the result into
work from your corpus            against it; map the terrain   manipulable, accessible form
```

Each methodology is independently useful. Together they form a complete pipeline from "I have an intuition" to "others can understand what I found."

## The Core Principle

The exploration phase and the formalization phase of mathematical research require different tools. These documents address the exploration phase — the phase where most ideas die not because they're wrong, but because the cost of checking whether they're connected to existing mathematics is prohibitive.

**AI lowers that cost dramatically. These methodologies exist to lower it without sacrificing rigor.**

What AI cannot do: verify proofs, produce citable claims, assess novelty. Those belong to the formalization phase and require independent verification.

What AI can do: reflect your intuition in multiple framings, access the texture of multiple mathematical traditions simultaneously, and lower the cost of cross-domain exploration to near zero. That is what these documents help you do well.

## Origins

These methodologies were developed over approximately 14 months of using Claude for advanced mathematical exploration spanning:
- Topos theory and geometric logic
- Condensed mathematics and p-adic geometry  
- Spectral theory and prime distribution
- Autonomous agent calculus (quantum mechanics formalism for agents with constrained choice)
- Interactive visualization of hypercomplex algebras
- Fréchet spaces, functional analysis, and their historical motivations

The documents are themselves products of the methodologies they describe — each was built using a Council session to generate the conceptual skeleton, and follows the Victor/Ciechanowski template in using concrete examples before formal structure.
