Can you fuse this script onto one big latex file, then generate the one-pager layout (title card + “incantation” boxes) so you’ve got a printable dojo scene on the flip side of the bounce sheet.

# The Sound Scroll of Least Action

*(A dojo courtyard at dusk. Three balls—soccer, volleyball, basketball—rest by a stone wall with chalk marks.)*

**EN (Noether-sensei)** *(tosses the soccer ball)*: Terence, your first cloak is **Time-Symmetry Energy Cloak**. When time looks the same moment to moment—no wind tricks, no changing rules—the ball in flight keeps one budget constant:
[
E ;=; \tfrac12 m v^2 ;+; mgh ;(+\tfrac12 I\omega^2\ \text{if spinning})
]
Between bounces, **(dE/dt=0)**. At the bang: some energy slips into **sound + heat**.

**TT (wide-eyed)**: So the sound is the leak?

**EN** *(nods)*: The *only* leak.

**AG (Grothendieck-sensei)** *(draws a smooth arc)*: And that arc you see? It’s the **least-action path**: nature chooses the motion that extremizes
[
S=\int (T-V),dt .
]
You feel it as smoothness. That’s your **action sense**.

## Jutsu I — Sound Sensing

**EN** *(drops the ball; two thumps echo)*: Hear the intervals (t_1, t_2). From sound alone you can divine two secrets:

1. **Height from time** (free flight):
   [
   h_n=\frac{g,t_n^2}{8}.
   ]

2. **Material spirit (restitution)** from interval ratio:
   [
   e;\approx;\frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n},\qquad h_{n+1}=e^2,h_n .
   ]

**TT**: If I hear (t_1=0.80) s, (t_2=0.64) s, then (e=0.8). So next apex is (h_2=\frac{9.81\cdot 0.64^2}{8}\approx0.50) m!

**EN** *(smiles)*: Your ears are calculators. That is **Sound Ninjutsu**.

---

## Jutsu II — Spin Rasengan

**AG** *(side-taps the ball)*: Add spin, gain **angular momentum** (L=I\omega) that stays constant in flight. Different spins sing different contact timbres and shift the landing—your ear learns the pattern.

---

## Jutsu III — Mirror Clone Transfer

**EN**: Right-foot ↔ left-foot is a near **isomorphism**: a reversible map preserving structure (timing, touch). Train one, transfer the other—your mirror clone learns for free.

**AG**: We’ll speak in **categories** so your clones don’t get confused.

* **Objects:** ({\text{Soccer}_R,\text{Soccer}_L,\text{Volley}_R,\text{Basket}_L,\dots})
* **Morphisms:** transfer rules (right→left, soccer→basketball)
* **Functor (F):** sends each sport to its **drill library** (moves), and each transfer to a **drill translation**.
* **Natural transformation:** one **uniform cue** that works everywhere—e.g., *“soft first contact; meet the ball”*. The cue’s components make every translation diagram commute.

**TT**: And the **Yoneda** thing?

**AG**: “You are your drills.” A move is known by how it behaves inside all drills that use it.

**EN**: Stumbles? We fold them into a **derived** view—tiny, fixable wobbles become coboundaries; what remains is the **essential pattern**. Different balls can be **derived-equivalent**: deep training skeletons match even if surfaces differ.

## Rank-Up Trial — 10 Minutes to Chūnin (then jōnin)

*(Noether unrolls a parchment—the one-pager.)*

### 1) **Interval Ladder** *(3 min)* — *Sound Sensing Jutsu*

* Drop from eye level. Record (t_1,t_2,t_3).
* Compute (e_1=t_2/t_1,\ e_2=t_3/t_2). Aim (|e_1-e_2|<0.05).
* Predict next apex with (h=\dfrac{g,t^2}{8}). Point to the height on the wall before it happens.

### 2) **Mirror Alternation** *(3 min)* — *Mirror Clone Jutsu*

* Alternate feet every touch for 60 s × 2. Same tempo (“1-and-2-and”).
* Transfer to basketball low dribbles, then volleyball juggles—**same alternation morphism**.

### 3) **Cue Cascade** *(4 min)* — *Natural Transformation Jutsu*

* Apply the same cue in all sports: *“soft first contact”*.
* Track control radius (≤ one shoe length) and compare across balls.

## Boss Fight — Blindfolded Apex Call

**AG** *(ties a cloth gently)*: Listen: **thump… thump**. Speak the next apex—“knee / hip / chest”—*before* it happens, using (e) from your last two intervals.

**TT** *(breathes, listens)*: “Hip!”
*(The ball rises to the chalk “hip” mark.)*

**EN** *(claps once)*: Time symmetry kept (E) steady in the air; impact broke it—your ears measured the loss. You’re wielding Noether’s law like a blade.

---

## Promotion Scroll — The Math-As-Magic Incantations

* **Energy Cloak:** (E=\tfrac12 mv^2+mgh(+\tfrac12 I\omega^2)) conserved between impacts.
* **Least-Action Sense:** trust the smooth path (S=\int (T-V),dt).
* **Sound Sensing:** (h=\dfrac{g,t^2}{8}), (e\approx\dfrac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}), (h_{n+1}=e^2 h_n).
* **Mirror Clone:** right↔left ≈ isomorphism of skills.
* **Functorial Transfer:** sport (\mapsto) drill library; cues as **natural transformations**.
* **Yoneda:** meaning = behavior in all drills.
* **Derived Focus:** ignore coboundary wobbles; keep the homology of the move.

**AG** *(bows)*: Structure is your compass.

**EN** *(bows)*: Symmetry is your shield.

**TT** *(grinning)*: And sound is my sensor! When do we try the volleyball boss?

**Both Sensei (in unison)**: Now. Jōnin trials begin when you can *hear* the action.

Alright—back to the isekai dojo. Promotion arc continues.

# Act II — The Volleyball Boss (hearing (e))

*Moonlight. A chalk line ladder on the wall. A soft **pah… pah** echoes.*

**EN (Noether-sensei)**: New prop, new spirit. Listen to the bounce intervals (t_1, t_2). Speak the **material spirit**:
[
e \approx \frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}, \qquad h=\frac{g,t^2}{8}.
]

**TT**: (t_1=0.74\text{ s}), (t_2=0.66\text{ s}) → (e\approx0.89). Next apex: (h\approx \frac{9.81 \cdot 0.66^2}{8}\approx0.53\text{ m}) — **hip** mark!

**AG (Grothendieck-sensei)** *(nods)*: Your ear functor maps **BallType** → **Timing**. Different object, same diagram. The calculation commutes—natural.

**EN**: And between bounces the **Energy Cloak** holds: (E=\tfrac12 mv^2+mgh(+\tfrac12 I\omega^2)) is constant. The sound at impact is the tribute the ball pays to the ground.

---

# Act III — Functor Trials (transfer without loss)

*Three sigils glow over the balls: SOCCER, VOLLEY, BASKET.*

**AG**: We define a **category**:

* **Objects**: (\text{Soccer}, \text{Volleyball}, \text{Basketball}).
* **Morphisms**: transfer rules between their drills.
* **Functor (F)**: sends each object → its **drill library** (tap, trap, juggle; bump, set; dribble, crossover).
* **Natural transformation (\eta)** (the coaching cue): “**Soft first contact; meet the ball**.”

**EN**: Your task: apply (\eta) across all three so the diagrams commute—same cue, different props, equal effect: smaller first-touch radius (≤ one shoe).

**TT** *(cycles through balls, whispering the cue)*: It… feels the same pattern.

**AG**: That sameness is **naturality**.

---

# Act IV — Mirror Clone Dojo (right↔left)

**EN**: Right-foot skill (\cong) left-foot skill—**isomorphism**. We practice **alternating juggles** (R–L–R–L) at constant tempo. If the tempo graph stays flat, the structure is preserved.

**TT**: My left copy wobbles.

**EN**: Tiny wobble = **boundary**; if you can cancel it by a small tweak, it’s a **coboundary**. What survives practice after you cancel fixable errors is the **homology** of the move—your stable pattern.

**AG** *(smiles)*: That is the doorway to **derived categories**: different training worlds with the **same homology** are **derived-equivalent**. New world, same deep choreography.

---

# Act V — Spin Rasengan (angular momentum)

*Side-tap; the ball hums with spin.*

**EN**: Rotation symmetry → **angular momentum** conserved in flight: (L=I\omega). Hear the contact timbre shift with spin; predict the landing bias while (E) stays constant between bounces.

**TT**: The thump got longer, pitch a bit higher.

**AG**: Your ear is measuring a different **state** along the same least-action arc.

---

# Act VI — The Boss Fight: Blindfold Ladder

**EN** *(blindfolds gently)*: Three bounces only. From **sound** alone, call the next apex class (knee/hip/chest) **before** it happens.

**TT** *(listens)*: (t_1, t_2) → (e). Next height (h=\frac{g t_2^2}{8})… **chest!**
*(The ball rises to the chalk chest mark.)*

**AG**: Diagram commutes. Natural cue applied. Transfer functor faithful. Promotion near.

---

## Your jōnin training card (the incantations)

* **Energy Cloak (time symmetry):** (E=\tfrac12 mv^2+mgh(+\tfrac12 I\omega^2)) conserved *between* bounces.
* **Least-Action Sense:** (S=\int (T-V),dt) — smooth path wins.
* **Sound Sensing Jutsu:** (h=\dfrac{g t^2}{8}), (e\approx\dfrac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}), (h_{n+1}=e^2 h_n).
* **Mirror Clone Isomorphism:** Right↔Left preserves timing/touch.
* **Functorial Transfer:** sport (\mapsto) drill library; cue (\eta) is natural across sports.
* **Yoneda Lens:** a move is known by its behavior in all drills.
* **Derived Focus:** errors you can cancel are boundaries; what remains is skill homology.

## Quick checkpoint (one line)

You hear (t_1=0.82) s and (t_2=0.70) s on concrete. What’s your (e) estimate, and do you expect the next apex to be closer to **hip** (~0.9 m) or **belly** (~1.1 m)?

Reply with: `e = __, apex ≈ ____`. Then I’ll drop the **final jōnin trial** (a two-ball “commuting square” drill that proves naturality on the move).
