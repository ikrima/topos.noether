# Comprehensive Insurance and Risk Management Advisory Plan for Brazos Built Right

## Executive Summary and Critical Recommendations

The College Station/Bryan construction market presents exceptional opportunities with record-breaking growth driven by Texas A&M's $500+ million expansion program and sustained regional development. For Brazos Built Right to capitalize on this momentum while managing risk effectively, implementing a comprehensive insurance program aligned with Texas market conditions and regulatory requirements is essential. **Total insurance costs should target 2-4% of annual revenue**, with strategic carrier selection and phased implementation optimizing coverage while controlling expenses.

The most critical immediate actions include securing workers' compensation coverage despite Texas's optional status, establishing $1M/$2M general liability limits as the industry standard, and developing strong contractual risk transfer protocols compliant with Texas anti-indemnity statutes. Given the local market's 36% year-over-year growth in building permits and identified $257.7 million gap in building materials supply, positioning for rapid scaling while maintaining appropriate risk management infrastructure is paramount.

## Texas Insurance Market Analysis and Carrier Recommendations

### Current market conditions favor new entrants with strategic positioning

The Texas construction insurance market has stabilized after several years of hard market corrections, with rate increases moderating to 5-15% across most coverage lines. **Workers' compensation remains the most stable line with flat to 5% increases**, while commercial auto continues challenging at 10-15% increases. Texas's business-friendly regulatory environment and "file and use" system allow carriers immediate rate implementation, attracting robust competition that benefits small contractors.

### Primary carrier recommendations based on Texas market presence

**CNA Insurance** emerges as the optimal primary carrier for Brazos Built Right, with specialized artisan contractor programs and Texas offices in Austin (9500 Arboretum Blvd), Dallas, and Houston. Their construction expertise and competitive small contractor pricing make them ideal for startup subcontractors. **Texas Mutual Insurance Company** should serve as the workers' compensation carrier, controlling 41.4% of the Texas market with an 11% rate decrease approved for July 2024. For excess coverage, **Liberty Mutual** offers flexible package policies with strong construction expertise through independent agents statewide.

Regional alternatives include **SureTec Insurance Company** (Houston-based) for artisan programs and **Acuity Insurance** for competitive small contractor packages. Establishing relationships with multiple carriers provides negotiating leverage and ensures coverage availability as the company grows.

## Comprehensive Coverage Specifications and Structure

### Core coverage architecture for residential startup phase

**General Liability Insurance** forms the foundation with $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate limits, matching what 97% of Texas contractors purchase. Expected annual premium ranges from $796-$1,230 based on current market data, representing 0.62-2.58% of revenue for small contractors. Coverage must include products/completed operations at $2M aggregate, $50,000 premises damage, and $5,000 medical payments.

**Workers' Compensation**, though optional in Texas, becomes mandatory for government contracts and provides critical employee protection. At Texas's favorable rate of $6.33 per $100 of payroll for general construction (among the nation's lowest), annual costs for a startup with $300,000 payroll approximate $19,000. Securing coverage positions Brazos Built Right for larger projects requiring this protection.

**Commercial Auto Insurance** requires $1M combined single limit minimum, exceeding Texas's 30/60/25 state minimums but meeting standard contractual requirements. Include hired and non-owned auto coverage for employee vehicles used for business, with expected annual premiums of $3,000-5,000 for small fleets.

### Specialized coverages for risk mitigation and growth

**Contractors Pollution Liability (CPL)** addresses environmental exposures from TCEQ regulations and stormwater management requirements. AIG Environmental's EAGLE program or Chubb's CPL coverage at $10-25M limits costs approximately $2,675 annually for small contractors, essential given Texas's strict environmental enforcement with penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation.

**Professional Liability/Contractors E&O** fills critical gaps where general liability excludes faulty workmanship, with average costs of $74/month providing $500,000-$2M limits. This coverage becomes increasingly important when transitioning to commercial projects with design-build elements.

**Cyber Insurance** addresses the construction industry's position as the #1 targeted sector in 2024 with 56% year-over-year attack increases. Basic coverage at $25,000-$100,000 limits costs approximately $1,200 annually, protecting against wire transfer fraud and ransomware averaging $292,000 in losses.

With Texas's base rate of $6.33 per $100 payroll, achieving a 0.85 experience mod versus 1.25 saves $12,000 annually on $300,000 payroll. Investment in safety training, weekly toolbox talks, and OSHA compliance typically returns 3:1 through premium reductions and avoided claims.

## Implementation Strategy and Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

Immediately secure general liability and workers' compensation through recommended carriers, establishing baseline protection for operations. File required TDLR electrical contractor bonds ($300,000 minimum coverage) and complete Texas Department of Insurance registration. Implement basic certificate of insurance tracking using ACORD forms, ensuring 30-day cancellation provisions given recent industry changes.

### Phase 2: Operational expansion (Months 3-6)

Add commercial auto coverage as vehicles are acquired, structuring as fleet program for economies of scale. Introduce professional liability coverage before accepting design-build responsibilities. Establish relationships with three insurance brokers specializing in construction: Marsh McLennan Agency (Dallas), Willis Towers Watson, and regional firm Wortham Insurance for competitive quoting.

### Phase 3: Commercial market entry (Months 7-12)

Layer pollution liability coverage meeting TCEQ construction general permit requirements for projects disturbing 1+ acres. Add $5M umbrella policy satisfying typical commercial project requirements. Implement cyber insurance protecting against construction industry's primary exposure to wire transfer fraud. Consider equipment floaters as owned equipment exceeds $50,000 value.

## Regulatory Compliance Framework

### TCEQ environmental requirements demand proactive management

Construction General Permit TXR150000 applies to all projects disturbing 1+ acres, requiring Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (SWP3) and Notice of Intent (NOI) submission through STEERS e-permitting. Authorization fees of $225 plus potential penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation necessitate robust compliance protocols. Partner with environmental consultants for Phase I/II assessments on brownfield sites, particularly given Texas's extensive industrial contamination history.

### Texas Department of Insurance and licensing alignment

While Texas requires no statewide general contractor license, specialty trades need TDLR licensing: electricians pay $110 application/$165 annual renewal with mandatory $300,000 liability insurance. Municipal requirements vary significantly - College Station and Bryan may require local registration and bonds ranging $5,000-$25,000. Maintain current documentation for all jurisdictions, as violations trigger work stoppage orders and permit ineligibility.

## Risk Transfer and Contractual Strategies

### Navigate Texas anti-indemnity statutes through sophisticated agreements

Texas Construction Anti-Indemnity Statute (2012) voids broad indemnification for indemnitee's own negligence except for indemnitor employee injuries. Structure agreements with proportional indemnification matching fault allocation. Require upstream additional insured status with primary and non-contributory language, ensuring your coverage responds first. Include mutual waiver of subrogation preventing insurer recovery actions between parties.

### Standardize subcontractor requirements matching industry norms

Mandate minimum $1M/$2M general liability with additional insured endorsements favoring Brazos Built Right. Require workers' compensation despite Texas's optional status, protecting against employee injury claims. Specify 30-day notice of cancellation with electronic delivery to multiple parties. Implement ConsensusDocs forms for balanced risk allocation versus AIA documents' owner-favorable provisions.

## College Station Market Opportunities and Positioning

### Local market dynamics favor prepared subcontractors

Bryan's 36% permit growth and College Station's record development activity create sustained demand exceeding current capacity. Texas A&M's $500+ million construction program including $181M veterinary complex and $200M space institute generates specialized subcontracting opportunities. The identified $257.7 million building materials gap suggests supply chain opportunities beyond traditional subcontracting.

### Strategic relationship development with key players

Prioritize relationships with **SpawGlass Construction** (4030 State Hwy 6 S), **MYCON General Contractors** (2501 Ashford Drive), and **Larry Young Paving** as established local generals. Join ABC Central Texas for networking and safety programs accessing the 1,700+ member network. Monitor Texas A&M System construction announcements for early positioning on institutional projects. Consider Aggie-owned contractor partnerships leveraging university connections.

## Weather and Environmental Risk Considerations

### Texas weather patterns require comprehensive protection

While College Station avoids coastal hurricane exposure, spring storms (March-May) and occasional freeze events like February 2021 create project delays and damage exposure. Builders risk insurance at 1-3% of project value should include flood coverage despite moderate FEMA risk ratings, as flash flooding from heavy rainfall remains possible. Structure contracts with weather delay provisions and force majeure clauses protecting against uncontrollable events.

### Environmental liability extends beyond traditional coverage

Construction activities near Edwards Aquifer recharge zones face heightened scrutiny and specialized requirements. Contractor pollution liability becomes essential for mechanical work involving underground storage tanks or historical contamination sites common in Texas's industrial areas. Maintain $10-25M CPL limits through AIG Environmental or Chubb, including emergency response protocols for the 24/7 incident support critical during environmental releases.

## Technology and Emerging Risk Management

### Construction cyber risks demand specialized attention

With construction ranking #1 for cyberattacks in Q2 2024 and 93% of ransomware including data theft, basic cyber coverage proves insufficient. Implement AXA XL's construction-specific endorsements covering missed bid reimbursements and BIM software vulnerabilities. Establish wire transfer verification protocols preventing the $2 million average losses from payment fraud. Budget $100-200 monthly for adequate cyber protection scaling with digital adoption.

### Safety technology investments reduce long-term costs

Deploy telematics for fleet management reducing commercial auto claims by 15-20%. Implement drone inspections minimizing fall exposures accounting for 31% of construction injuries. Utilize AI-powered safety monitoring identifying hazards before incidents occur. Document safety investments for insurance credit - 60% of Texas contractors increasing AI investment see premium reductions and improved experience modifications.

## Performance Metrics and Success Indicators

Monitor insurance costs maintaining 2-4% of revenue through strategic carrier management and safety improvements. Track experience modification targeting 0.85 or below through proactive loss control. Measure certificate compliance achieving 100% collection before subcontractor mobilization. Evaluate claim frequency maintaining below industry average of 2.6 injuries per 100 workers. Review carrier relationships annually ensuring competitive pricing amid market changes.

Success manifests through securing preferred contractor status with major College Station generals, qualifying for government and institutional projects requiring comprehensive insurance, and maintaining profitability while scaling operations in the high-growth Brazos Valley market. The insurance program should evolve from basic protection to competitive advantage, enabling pursuit of larger, more complex projects while managing total cost of risk effectively.
