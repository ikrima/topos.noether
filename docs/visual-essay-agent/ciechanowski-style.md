# Ciechanowski Method: Quick Reference Card

## The Five Commandments

1. **SHOW BEFORE EXPLAIN** — The complete system working is the opening. Wonder precedes understanding.

2. **MANIPULATE TO UNDERSTAND** — If they can't drag it, rotate it, or scrub through it, they don't really get it.

3. **COLOR IS VOCABULARY** — Assign persistent semantic colors. The **yellow mainspring** is ALWAYS yellow.

4. **FAIL FIRST** — "Unfortunately, this won't work—you can witness why..." then reveal the solution.

5. **MATH LAST** — Build visual intuition → identify pattern verbally → show relationship graphically → THEN formula.

## Structural Rhythm

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OPENING: Full system, interactive  │  ← "Wow, how does this work?"
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ZOOM IN: Simplest component        │  ← "Let's start with..."
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PROBLEM: "Unfortunately..."        │  ← Let them witness failure
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SOLUTION: Next component           │  ← "Thankfully, we can..."
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  REPEAT: Problem → Solution chain   │  ← Progressive complexity
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ZOOM OUT: Reconnect to whole       │  ← "Now let's see it all together"
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CLOSING: Philosophical reflection  │  ← "A true mastery of engineering"
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## Interaction Toolkit

| Pattern | Use When | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Drag-rotate** | 3D object examination | "Drag to change viewing angle" |
| **Slider-as-time** | Temporal process | "Scrub to see mechanism in action" |
| **Slider-as-parameter** | Variable exploration | "Adjust frequency to hear difference" |
| **Click-highlight** | Showing influence | "Click a point to see its effect" |
| **Side-by-side** | Comparison | "Left: wrong, Right: correct" |
| **Cutaway slider** | Revealing internals | "Use slider to peek inside" |

## Voice Cheat Sheet

### Opening Hooks
- "In the world of [everyday context], it may be hard to believe that..."
- "Over the course of this article I'll explain the workings of..."
- "You can drag the [object] around to change your viewing angle"

### Transitions
- "Let's see what happens when..."
- "Unfortunately, this approach has a fatal flaw..."
- "Thankfully, we can solve this with..."
- "Before we continue, it's worth pausing to..."
- "There's one clever bit hiding in plain sight..."

### Observations
- "Notice that as you [action], the [element] [behavior]..."
- "You may have realized that..."
- "It may not be immediately clear, but..."
- "You can witness this in the demonstration below..."

### Technical Terms
- "This process is called *[term]*..."
- "...known as the *[term]* – [brief explanation]"
- "The [jargon], which is simply [plain explanation]..."

### Closings
- "Despite all these [limitations], these [systems] show true mastery of [field]"
- "With creative use of [components], a [subject] rises from [simple state] to become [poetic description]"

## Color Coding Rules

1. Assign colors in FIRST demonstration
2. Use **bold** for inline references: "the **yellow barrel** rotates..."
3. Maximum 6 semantic colors per essay
4. Muted palette, vivid for focus elements
5. NEVER reassign a color to a different concept

## Accessibility Must-Haves

- [ ] Unit system toggle (imperial/metric)
- [ ] Global animation pause control
- [ ] Touch AND mouse support
- [ ] "Save power" option mentioned
- [ ] Graceful degradation if WebGL fails

## The Bartosz Test

Before publishing, ask:

1. Could someone understand this with JUST the interactives? (text off)
2. Does every paragraph within 3 of an interactive?
3. Would a curious 14-year-old AND a domain expert both enjoy this?
4. Did I let them DISCOVER the insight or just TELL them?
5. Is there genuine WONDER in this? Do I care about what I'm explaining?

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

❌ Start with definitions or formulas  
❌ Use static diagrams where interaction is possible  
❌ Change color meanings mid-essay  
❌ Explain something the reader can figure out by playing  
❌ Wall of text without interactive break  
❌ End abruptly without reflection  
❌ Condescend ("Simply put..." / "Obviously...")  
❌ Hide the complexity instead of revealing its elegance
